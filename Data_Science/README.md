## Project(s)
### [Project 1: Predicting Stroke Using Machine Learning (Classification)](Classification_Stroke)
  > We aim to visualize the relationships between various habits/factors and strokes & predict stroke events with the best model and hyper-tuned parameters.

The original data came from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).
