## Project(s)
### [Project 1: Predicting Stroke Using Machine Learning (Classification)](Classification_Stroke)
  > We aim to visualize the relationships between various habits/factors and strokes & predict stroke events with the best model and hyper-tuned parameters.

The original data came from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).

## Project(s)
### [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis Of Steam Game Reviews (Black Myth: Wukong)](Sentiment-Analysis_Game-Reviews)
  > We aim to develop a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Steam reviews for Black Myth: Wukong. This model will identify key drivers of positive and negative user sentiment, providing actionable insights to help game developers address weaknesses and implement data-driven improvements that enhance player satisfaction.

The data was scraped from the [Steam Review Page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/reviews/) for the game from *10 September 2024* to *14 November 2024* (around 2 months).
