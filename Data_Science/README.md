## Projects
### [Project 1: Predicting Stroke Using Machine Learning (Classification)](Classification_Stroke)
  > We aim to visualize the relationships between various habits/factors and strokes & predict stroke events with the best model and hyper-tuned parameters.

The original data came from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).

### [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis Of Steam Game Reviews (Black Myth: Wukong)](Sentiment-Analysis_Game-Reviews)
  > We aim to develop a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Steam reviews for Black Myth: Wukong. This model will identify key drivers of positive and negative user sentiment, providing actionable insights to help game developers address weaknesses and implement data-driven improvements that enhance player satisfaction.

The data was scraped from the [Steam Review Page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/reviews/) for the game from *10 September 2024* to *14 November 2024* (around 2 months).

### [Project 3: Sales & Customers Insights (Tableau)](Tableau_Sales-Customers-Insights)
  > We aim to build two dashboards using Tableau to help stakeholders (including sales managers and executives) analyze sales performance and customers. The sales dashboard presents an overview of the sales metrics and trends to analyze year-over-year sales performance and understand sales trends. The customer dashboard provides an overview of customer data, trends and behaviours. It will help marketing teams and management to understand customer segments and improve customer satisfaction.

The data was obtained from [DATA with BARAA](https://www.datawithbaraa.com/tableau/tableau-sales-project-thank-you/#google_vignette).
