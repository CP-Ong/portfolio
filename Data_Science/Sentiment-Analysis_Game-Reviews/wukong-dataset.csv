7,"I literally found myself saying out loud ""I don't think this is a fun game"".Immediately it doesn't feel rewarding in either fighting or game progression. It's just mini-bosses with hardly any mobs between them, leaving most of the game play being boss fights that you die over and over to until you figure out their moves.To make it worse, the fighting itself just doesn't feel good. For a game that is supposed to reward technical game play, you are locked out of dodging often with attack animations and jumps don't avoid AOE boss attacks, leading to boring run away and wait game play.",Not Recommended,486,5.7 hrs on record,Posted: 13 November
8,"It is my firs time playing a souls-like game, and I have really enjoyed it, perhaps some people wouldn't like the non-open world but I think it let's you enjoyed the real story of the character and also thanks to this you only really need to focus in going berserk, 100% would recommend it",Recommended,236,5.5 hrs on record,Posted: 13 November
9,"The first four chapters are really impressive, and the final boss fight is one of the best I've ever played. However, the fifth and the sixth chapters are full of flaws and traces of unfinished works. Additionally, the seller's intention of using gender discrimination to create trend is unforgivable. Overall, valuable gaming experience.",Recommended,286,39.5 hrs on record,Posted: 13 November

16,"I'll start off by saying that I don't think that the lack of a map does this game any favours, especially considering how many missable achievements there are (thought the game does offer an obscene amount of automatic backups, which is always great). That aside, this is easily a 9/10 and the true GOTY of this year. The content is neither too hard neither too easy. Taking damage during cinematics is kind of unfair, but It's nothing you cannot play around. Absolute must try if you like souls games.",Recommended,414,50.5 hrs on record,Posted: November 14
17,"In my opinion, this is a true Game of the Year contender! It’s perfect for those who want to take on a challenge but feel hesitant about games like Dark Souls, Elden Ring is demanding, but not as brutally difficult as those titles. The game has an incredible atmosphere, with controls that are smooth and intuitive. Another strong point is the ability to create various builds to suit different playstyles. There’s truly something for everyone.It’s a must play for fans of Chinese culture, as it’s simply impossible to be disappointed by it. Even after finishing the game for the first time, there’s still a strong desire to dive back into NG+, where you can acquire additional items and skills. This feature keeps you motivated to replay, offering new challenges and fresh approaches to tackling bosses.",Recommended,670,42.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 14
18,"Phenomenal gaming experience from start to finish. Worth the hype and well worth full price. Easily lands in my Top Ten List of All Time. With ultra smooth combat and a diverse move/ability set. The combinations are endless and there is really no penalty for trying out every build available. Engaging story, each chapter has a theme that fits narratively and with the scenery and characters. I am not a person to replay games frequently but I am excited to play this one through again.",Recommended,402,178.7 hrs on record,Posted: November 14

25,"On the subject of the world.Beautiful game. On one hand, there are so many secrets and so much lore, on the other hand, invisible walls everywhere that kind of slap you in the face when you try to explore. It's inviting and closed up at the same time, not a fan of that.On the subject of combat.I like the instant respec, makes fighting entertaining. Large bosses/quick moving bosses/flying bosses' hit boxes and tracking not fantastic. At the same time not locking on was not feasible for me either. I would look for some improvements there.Huge discrepancies among boss difficulty - 90% pushovers into 10% impossible without learning the fights. Maybe slightly too many micro-cutscenes during major boss fights too.Side notes.Had to learn closing my eyes on loading screens - the game spoiled itself on new areas, or was showing me second phases of the bosses I was currently fighting which I haven't seen before - huge no no.What's with the boss talking during the fight, who came up with that, I can never hear or focus on what they are hearing, just play the music and let me enjoy the fight.Overall positive, great game with a couple of thorns in it, so not exactly 10/10 but close.",Recommended,982,64.1 hrs on record,Posted: November 14

39,"Incredible graphics, sound design, voice acting and story telling. Although the play time for a full playthrough takes ~40-50 hours depending on skill level and whether you're going for the true ending, buying the game is money well spent.The 6 environments for the 6 chapters are stunning. Each visually different from each other, with multiple levels, whole secret areas which you may not stumble upon during first playthrough, but not too open world that you do not know what to do. The sound design is incredible, every piece suits the fight and the effect sounds for the weapons etc. are very satisfying. Combat flows well with a wide array of skills and weapon effects to choose from, with some transformations requiring a lot more skill than others. The camera does get a bit jittery when facing large bosses and locked-on, but this is a problem most Souls-likes face.It is more forgiving than Souls-likes which is most pronounced in the mid to late game when you can respec into any build depending on the boss encounter. However, there are still fights that are challenging, but also graphically stunning. You could argue the true ending route has the hardest boss in-game. The only flaw is that for certain boss encounters, you start off in the middle of a phase if you have managed to beat the previous ones - this reduces some of the continuity of the fight but makes it much more approachable for casual players as they do not have to fight phase 1 etc. again.The animation pieces after each chapter is the cherry on top for the game, ranging from animation to stop motion. You really get a sense that a lot of love was poured into the game which took nearly a decade to develop. Would highly recommend picking up this game. The deluxe edition is only there to support the creators given the curios/armour set/weapon given are quickly outscaled",Recommended,1536,54.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 14

58,"I beat the game just so i didn't have to hear the argument ""get good"". The game isn't bad, however it isn't as good as described. some enemies feel unbalanced ( tentacle man ) for example and no real way to deal with ranged enemies except rush them. the lack of weapon diversity, there are a number of pole-arms that could have been added. I also wanted to see more options with armor and abilities. I found the story to be far too short for my liking. lastly the last boss fight is for lack of a better term bs and felt like i was being trolled, i enjoyed no part of it. overall great story but the gameplay felt ... incomplete and lacking.story: 8/10combat: 5/10level design: 5/10value: 4/10",Not Recommended,565,60.8 hrs on record,Posted: November 13

The final boss is a perfect example of why the design of several bosses don't work, every single ability and attack you spent 40+ hours collecting get countered randomly by the boss. The entire encounter just feels like several rng checks in a row. he has a random chance to counter your heavy attack, imobilize, healing, duplicates, light attack, and if you think he's not countering enough don't worry because he will freeze you in time so that he gets a garenteed hit that you have no way of avoiding. i don't think there was a single boss that i fought that left me feeling satisfied with the accomplishment. i give it 4/10",Not Recommended,870,44.7 hrs on record,Posted: November 13

142,"Steam doesn't have a ""It Depends"" option. Although, I am giving it a ""Yes"" and enjoyed the story, there are things I found during my time with this game that you may like to know before you buy -a) The gameplay loop is exciting at first but gets repetitive very quickly.b) The camera during boss fights has a mind of its own. It frequently focuses away from the boss and I ended up getting hit because I couldn't see the attack.c) The game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to try the various stances. I found myself sticking to a single playstyle throughout the game.d) Most of the mini/optional/secret bosses become way too easy midway through the game. I would have liked them to be bit more of a challenge.Like I said before, I loved the story and it has made me want to read the Journey to the West books. There are a ton of positives .a) Game looks gorgeous. I got about 90 frames (DLSS with Frame gen) with a 4080 on 4k Cinematic preset with RT Maxed out.b) Boss battles have good rewards and the game is generous with XP. Crafting is not a chore.c) The dialogue and the music is absolutely brilliant. Especially the headless singer from C2 !d) A lot of secrets to uncover and it's always worth taking the time to do them.There are tons of positives I am sure I have missed out and a lot of other reviews have covered. I think it comes down to whether you can look past the gripes I covered earlier. If you can, then it's a great buy, else I would recommend getting this on a sale.",Recommended,1213,97.6 hrs on record,Posted: November 12

150,"I'm not one of those soulslike fans who seek games that will punish them, but for this one I had to make an exception. I'd been waiting for its release for years, as I find Chinese mythology fascinating, and a AAA game based on Journey to the West sounded impossibly awesome.Once I finally got to play it, I got very close to dropping it on more than one occasion in the early chapters (spent 3 straight hours banging my head against that one giant rat), but I'm very glad I persevered.The aesthetics are unlike anything I've seen in a videogame, beautiful and awe-inspiring, immersing the player in a magical, semi-fictional, but distinctly Chinese setting.The story avoids verbose lore dumps (though the detailed journal entries are a nice touch), and instead maintains the mystical atmosphere through minimalistic character interactions, hints for the player to piece together, and gorgeous animated sequences with limited dialogue at the end of each chapter (while still dropping in some delightful JttW fanservice where appropriate).The gameplay itself is primarily made up of numerous boss fights interspersed with some exploration, and the character-building/RPG elements are nice but nothing to write home about. Still, while this can be frustrating early on for anyone who's not into that kind of stuff, there's definitely something to the feeling of getting more skilled at it as time went on, and ultimately developing that inner peace, that zen-like confidence that whatever challenge the game throws at me, I would eventually overcome.All in all, I'd say the game was everything I'd hoped for since I saw that first trailer in 2020, and more.In more ways than one, it opened my eyes to cultures I wouldn't have experienced any other way, and there's not much more I can ask for in a game.",Recommended,1504,84.4 hrs on record,Posted: November 12

Exploration is very solid, not best in class but certainly not the worst. The music and storytelling are some of the best we have seen in gaming in probably a decade, the graphics are great.

187,"""This game taught me to git gud.""As a fan of JTTW, you certainly don't wanna miss Black Myth: Wukong! That is if you're also into action games, while it can be difficult for some but it's definitely worth playing.Not trying to be bias here, but the game's a blessing in a way for most of us, as JTTW fans. To be fair I've not watched the OG 1986 Journey to the West, only 96' TVB version and some other films.. it may not be the greatest adaptation, however I did enjoy the show as a kid. Been waiting for the game since the first trailer around 4 years ago, it did not disappoint.Timeline is set after JTTW, basically like a sequel, the story seemed to be very well-thought-out. A masterpiece, I'd say. The lore and backstory may be confusing for players who aren't familiar with JTTW though, some are explained in the ""Journal"", they're long but pretty interesting read. It's not perfect still, due to some flaws such as some minor lighting bugs, camera angles on certain fights and invisible walls in most areas. Game design is alright, there is no map nor indicator so it may be an issue for anyone with memory and/or just couldn't travel around the place much due to time constraint. Just don't go diving into the game expecting it to be like some sort of chill RPG, or wise you'd be greatly disappointed. You don't get to beat small baddies much, because you'll run into bosses as you progress the story. Game completion time varies, main story can be completed in less than 50 hours, it would definitely go higher if you'd also do other objectives. Do note that some quests/objectives are highly missable in the run. Game visual looks absolutely stunning, the animations and arts are very impressive too. Soundtracks are great, especially the final boss part. Combat is pretty decent, great variety of abilities to choose from. Often times activating abilities and healing feels like there's a delay to it though, perhaps that's just how it's intended to be in the game. Difficulty-wise it starts off souls-like kinda style, but as the player progress on upgrading better stats after (presumably around Chapter 2-3) it will eventually feel more of a hack n' slash.. I find some of the bosses are tough to beat still. Nevertheless I've beaten the game (aside from missing a few quests) at 110+- hours with most of the time, occasionally with a few stat boost from medicine. There's just lots of stuff to do in the game, that said it's quite time consuming for achievement hunters.Despite some of those mentioned flaws but the game's easily 10/10 for me.

189,"After 5 hours i still can not like this game. I like the world, the setting, the audio is phantastic, as the graphics, the story. Everything is great besides the combat, especially the bosses.I play soulslike games since Demon's souls. What i love about them is the non-linear approach you can have. Ofc there are some key bosses that you need to kill before continuing the story. But I can always explore the world until you find other stuff, equipment, level up other skills, weapons, armour, spells. If you dont manage to kill a certain boss, go to another area, come back later when you feel strong enough.Wukong has none of that. The levels are tube-like, with nothing to explore. Yes you can find some very few spells on the way. But they dont change the tactics in combat, especially not against bosses. The only thing you can do is dodge. Dodge, wait for a small opening, chip some damage, wait for stun spell, repeat. There are no different approaches but dodging, dodging, dodging. I believe searching the level area makes up 10% of time, while fighting and dodging in bossfights is 90%.Each boss gets more and more spongy. Their movesets have built-in irregularites that make them even less predictable to dodge, overall just annoying (e.g. Fire bear teleportation in second phase when he flies over the battlefield. You hear the indication on 4 of his attacks, but not for the last teleport before he leaves teleportation state).And after defeating the area boss, you most certainly get equipment with benefits against that certain boss you just killed.

199,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES.It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud""",Not Recommended,2514,61.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 11

206,"9/10 Almost a Masterpiece. A few thoughts:- Let's be real, this is a Dark Souls copy. If Fromsoft released this no one would bat an eye but that being said, I like it more than the Darksouls series. Your attacks feel strong and you learn a variety of spells and transformations that make you feel powerful and not just random guy stabbing a boss in the butt to death.- The difficulty is perfect, not utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like Darksouls but not too easy like Jedi Survivor. Some bosses definitely need more time to cook though. The white dragon has a terrible hitbox, the Deer is annoying af, the last giant rock boss is boring to kill just to name a few.- They really didn't have to copy EVERYTHING from the Fromsoft. The cryptic quests and storylines are super annoying. I LIKE the story and I WANT to know more but half the time I feel like I have no idea whats going on. I even knew (roughly) the story of Journey to the West but still was confused.- So much stuttering, stutters in cut-scenes, stutters in traversal, STUTTERS EVEN IN THE ENDING CREDITS WTF- Chapter 6 area definitely felt rushed. I get that the cloud is super iconic but they should've made it into a bullet-hell shooter (like Nier Automata) instead you're just flying around in an large empty area with a few bosses scattered around.",Recommended,1065,43.1 hrs on record,Posted: November 11
207,"As someone who grew up watching the 1996 Journey to the West series on TV, I can say this game really brings that story to life. The developers have done an impressive job capturing the heart of the classic tale, balancing nostalgia with accessibility for new players.Yes, there are some tweaks to the storyline, but they’re well-considered adjustments that actually help the flow of the game’s shorter runtime. It keeps the pace snappy without losing the essence of the journey we all know and love. Despite some controversy in the Western media, this game shines on its own merits, offering a fresh, respectful take on the classic tale. If you ask me, it absolutely deserves a Game of the Year title.",Recommended,582,69.9 hrs on record,Posted: November 11
208,"iNViSiBle wAlL.....But the boss fight is sick and most of them are memorable, OK difficulty and don't have to worry about losing anything if you die like in soulsgame. Areas in some chapters are worth exploring, some feels rushed and the invisible wall kinda ruin the exploration part.Reigniting sparks (ReSpec) in shrine let you try different kind of build without worrying a finite item needed since you can basically do it every time you wish.Graphic is great but suffer for performance issue from time-time, even if you lower the setting, maybe that's an optimisation problem?Weapon options... well you only have the staff, you can upgrade it to a better one or the spear if you like, but this lack of variety can be compensate a lil bit with the transformation (if you're into that kind of build) which gave you a whole new moveset and ways to play. The stances aren't really giving any thing since it only alters your heavy attack (and some chained attack) but your light attack stays the same.A pretty solid game overall.

239,"Honest Review for Black Myth: WukongTLDR: Overall Rating 9/10This was a game I was very excited for, since a long time. Being non-Chinese, I had 0 knowledge about the legend of Wukong. But being a fantasy and historical story fan and the fact that the game required a little skill enticed me. After playing this game, and following up with dozens of lore videos and interacting with native Chinese people online I've gained much more appreciation for how much love and effort the developers put into the game.This is not a souls-like game. In fact, only enemy respawns on resting and boss difficulty are similar to souls-like games. Initially, this game felt more similar to ghost of tsushima due to its skill tree, but again that's the only similar mechanic from there. This game picks few good mechanics from many games and puts it into one cohesive playstyle and it does not feel out of place at all. In fact it improves them. For example, the focus building on hit is similar to Final Fantasy, but differs from it since you can retain that focus indefinitely unless you rest or use a spirit. Perfect dodging is similar to Nier Automata but differs since you cannot do in indefinitely due to limited stamina and can accrue passive effect on doing it.Honestly, I was quite disappointed after the first 2 chapters. However, the game does pick up pace from chapter 3 onwards with much more to see and explore. It more than redeems itself after that and personally this is GOTY for me. Here's a detailed explanation of why I think so:WEAKNESSES:This game does have a fair few weaknesses. To start off, the game is a little bit buggy, although recent patches from the developers have fixed majority of the nagging issues, it is still not completely free of them. I ran this on an RTX 4060 and 16 GB DDR5 RAM on high settings and I finished the game on the same settings. It mostly performs fine, but would crash at least twice in a 3-4 hour play session - the most frequent cause being ""video card out of memory"" which seems to be the common problem with everybody. Clearing cache and restarting the game would fix this 95% of the time. The game is quite heavy with a LOT of ambient occlusion and lighting effects. On default, has around 30-40 fps, but with DLSS3 and Ray Tracing gives 50-60 on high settings. If the boss uses lightning attacks, then it'll tank further. On a different note, Sometimes autosave would fail due to insufficient memory when I had around 13 GB of free disk space. Closing the game would reinstate all 13 GB back and would work fine then onwards. This is probably how the saving is designed to work and not a bug - but this only happened thrice in my entire 65 hours of play time.Moving on, the first 2 chapters are ... ""less impressive"". They honestly felt very bland with almost no background music or much to see or explore. Many of the negative reviews I see on steam haven't played beyond chapter 2, which honestly also caused me to lose a bit of interest. Chapter 1 feels like a boss rush, since from the first second onwards, you are thrown into enemies. The map design for chapter 1 also feels rushed and poor but is fantastic for chaps 3&4. There are invisible walls everywhere which is honestly quite annoying, especially for someone like me who likes exploring areas, climbing on random things and hearing what sounds grass makes when walked on or when a box breaks etc. Many of the other games love you doing this and often award you for exploring inconspicuous areas which this game only does from chapter 3 onwards (a little bit in chapter 2). It almost feels as if chapter 1 was designed last minute in a rush after everything else was finished. I would've also loved to see more secrets and rewards on mount huaguo. I'll not spoil the surprise here for anyone who hasn't played, but I'll just say that much of the map is barren and doesn't really reward you to explore and walk around different areas apart from celestial cavalry ready to whoop your ass but being worse/weaker that the wolf guais in chapter 1.The game has a perfect dodge mechanic which is great most of the time, but is sometimes janky, especially when strong enemies do grab attacks. In this case, perfect dodge is almost non-existent and you need to dodge much quicker. Becomes especially tricky when bosses do a sequence of attacks with grab in between or at the end.Next, the lock-on mechanic - honestly it is one of the best lock-on mechanics I've seen in games since it auto enables and disables when enemies disappear (at least most of the times) and even let's you know which enemy is attacking if there are multiple. However, physically bigger enemies have multiple lock on points like the head and body where naturally hitting the head will do more damage and you can toggle between both targets. However, sometimes this does not work as intended, especially for Kang-Kin Loong, to whom you cannot lock-on to the head when the boss is stunned and falls to the ground. You have either have to hit the body or cancel lock-on and manually hit him with a chance to miss. Similarly, for some other big enemies, although you can lock-on to the head when stunned, you sorta slide off when hitting and move to the body.The game has plenty of incentive to do a NG+ run but the proportion of rewards to time spent in NG+ is not worth it. For example, I have to complete the Journey 3 times perfectly and have all 18 relics to unlock wukong stance permanently. Nah, I'd rather we have the wukong stance from 2nd cycle itself and test out all the new mechanics for it to have value doing a 2nd run. There are people who'd do it, but for me, it is not worth it.NEUTRAL:Duplicates are extra monke. Sometimes 1 or 2, just stand there doing nothing while others attack the boss. Some just miss. If you upgrade pluck of many to increase your duplicates and the boss is physically small, you won't have enough space to get your own hits in. You'll just slide off or teleport to the other side.Moving on, the UI design for the most part is great, but is not perfect, especially the keeper's shrine UI being unintuitive especially for the fast travel mechanic. This follows a tree format with picture to help you make sure and even small marks indicating NPCs which is great, but this could be improved with small arrows on the main locations to show that I can actually expand that tab, which confused me the first time I was playing.The overall game itself is a fever dream for most Chinese and anyone closely familiar with or grew up with the story of Wukong. However, for newcomers like me, it doesn't really explain any story at all, but does attempt to do it with lengthy stories in the Journal, which more or less explain the broad idea of the character - but for much bigger characters it gives you hints, riddles or easter eggs that only those with depth of understanding with the story can relate to and appreciate.STRENGTHS:The gameplay itself has mostly been perfected where nothing feels extra, and everything meshes together. Visuals are fantastic and environments are surreal. The sound effects and ambience are so realistic that one of them reminded me of childhood, especially the temple of yellow flowers. However, the desert was so realistic, that it was boring and bland.The game has plenty of mechanics, except swimming, all perfected. The secrets are worth doing and are intrinsically linked to the actual story where wukong struggled against yaoguai kings and would only win through smartness and use of vessels - which the games makes you feel for yourself. It also makes the bosses easier if you desire, but adds much more depth to the story. The game is not too difficult as many sound it to be. I beat most bosses in 3-4 tries, except 4 kings which took 15 tries. (redacted due to word limit).Overall, I'm glad I continued the game and am truly wowed by the game and that I got to know the story.

The musical score, imagery, set design, costumes, narrative, dialogue, and end-chapter animations all demonstrate the dedication of the creators to deliver a complete, unparalleled, and profound experience. Using the Journey to the West as a framework but then telling an original tale of the thereafter is an intriguing premise; the developers have painstakingly studied the subject matters of Buddhism/Daoism/Folk-Lore/History, and then represented the cycles beautifully - even using a cycle of rebirth to encourage players to pursue New Game Plus, as the journey is not satisfied with a single attempt.The vast majority of the fights are well choreographed, cinematic, and are a well balanced challenge - players are left with a sense of accomplishment with each major enemy felled and should they not succeed, you feel outmaneuvered / bested rather than cheated. They encourage you to improve and learn the move sets of the opponents. Additionally, the ability to reallocate resources without finite consumables encourages a variety of playstyles and experimentation.Words fall short to give credit to this game and it cannot be recommended enough, even if one were just to spectate another's play-thru, it would certainly be worth the experience.A thousand thanks to Game Science for this marvelous title.While nothing is ever truly perfect, this is the closest one can ever hope to.",Recommended,1269,88.2 hrs on record,Posted: November 11

328,"BLACK MYTH: WUKONG AAA+Welcome to this visual feast for your eyes, gripping story with unexpected twists and turns. This game is a great introduction to the popular Chinese story The Monkey Kings ""journey to the west"". Lots of fun moments and plenty of infuriating boss fights you'll no doubt enjoy sinking your teeth into.I'm currently chapter 3 of a potential 5 (i think) and lost a little momentum playing ""??but this is a positive review so why would you mention such things??"" i was on it every day for the first 4 weeks pretty much for a couple hours a day but has dropped to a day a week due to personal reasons so progress has fallen off considerably. Having said that i haven't found it hard to pick back up after a break which makes it even more enjoyable and even more importantly revisit-able.There's more than meets the eye with this monkey, if you can get your timing down he's almost invincible, with his acrobatic moves and exquisite kung-fu style stick attacks its very rewarding beating the brakes off your enemy's... now don't get me wrong a normal low level enemy will kill you in a heartbeat if you're caught lacking but when you're on a good run its like you cant be touched.It can be a grind at times, which if you're looking for a game to get lost in it fills that criteria to a T, this is definitely one of those you can really forget the world around you and give your brain a break from reality to concentrate on becoming the monkey king you've always aspired to be xDWould fully recommend to any souls players who are unsure or anyone who's genuinely just undecided with the spare cash.Skill tree x10 plus rewarding building your character to fit your play style.Predominantly linear story with a hefty amount of side quest, open world style layout but in levels/ sections (plenty of youtube vids to explain that word vomit :) or just get it and take a look for yourself.Good luck to all who venture forth.",Recommended,1587,29.9 hrs on record,Posted: November 10

IGN rating :~ 8/102. Game play:➡️Mechanics: one of the best fight mech, insane level of detailsControls: pc will work but recommended to play with controllerDifficulty: the difficulty level is less than < ELDEN RING> <DARK SOUL III > and learning curveis good u will learn how the combo works and use different tactic to defeat boss .Progression: game's progression system is good u get diff items which help u to defeat bosses,such as leveling up will Inc. your mana ,defence, attack ,dodge and many more ....story advancementwill give u insane level of knowledge ho wukong defeats his friend or unlocking new content.3.Graphics and Sound:➡️Visuals: ITS A AAA game its made in unreal 5 best graphics u can get in 2024 just like Baldur's gate 3 and elden ring this won ""game of year award in 2023"" At least 36 real-world locations were minutely selected to serve as the game's backdrop,including Dule Temple (獨樂寺) in Jixian, Tianjin, Jade Emperor Temple (玉皇廟)in Jincheng, Shanxi, and Dazu Rock Carvings (大足石刻) in Chongqing.Audio: sound effect of game is on peak but better to play in Chinese lang because if u p[lay in English it will ruin the game play and experience . Do they enhance the gaming experience? yes the dialouge in between game is insane the also and dialouge intraction with enemy and after deffeting the will show u animation .4. Story and Characters:➡️Plot: NO spoilers , but Black Myth: Wukong continues the story of Sun Wukong, which was made famous in the classic Chinese tale, Journey to the West. .Characters: WOKONG DIES u will play a normal monkey to change your destiny.well story compelling and well-written will ingage u to play but its will maku u piss off u will die 10 or 20s or more if u dont have patient.5.Replayability:➡️Content: How much content does the game offer? Are there reasons to replay it? yes the game offer u different ending if u miss any boss u have to replay to gain diff ending .Multiplayer:NO , nee , niet , nahi , voch ,non ,la ,hapana ,Bù and conti........6.Performance and Technical Aspects:➡️Performance: game's performance is best , u can get 200+ frame ratein RTX 4090, 4080 easily, load lime is like 2 min if u start and saders pack installing..Bugs and Issues: no technical issues,YES bugs,glitches encountered.Dont worry patches will fix it .7.Overall Enjoyment:➡️Pros and Cons:At its core, Black Myth: Wukong is a good action RPG with excellent combat mechanics, phenomenal cinematic boss battles, and some of the best audiovisual presentation in modern gaming. Unfortunately, however, it's held back from true greatness by very underwhelming level designs, poor enemy variety, and a completely redundant gear system.8.STEAM CHART record:- all time peak-2,406,96724-hours peak 103,966last 30 days - 64,716",Recommended,2477,29.9 hrs on record,Posted: November 9

399,"I'm going to preface this by saying BMW is hands down the Game of the Year. It's a complete and coherent product in a way very few games have achieved this year or even this decade. It manages to write a sequel to Journey to the West while reworking the original that possible rivals or even surpasses the original story and the classic TV series. However, as a GAME, I cannot recommend it to most people unless you know what you are getting yourself into.If you like Souls-like game, this MAY be for you. But I'm going to break down why you may not enjoy BMW. The TLDR is that it's a very ""defensive"" Souls-like that is missing some ""modern features"".1. There is no move cancel. Meaning once you commit to an attack move, you are committed. You can dodge out of it. So you have to be VERY selective when you attack and how many times you press the attack button. Combined with the loooooong attack animations, you're ask to get hit if you do long combos on bosses that do not have breaks in their combos. This is the biggest thing that turns me off.2. There is no dodge buffer. One modern game design feature is a dodge buffer. What is it? It's when a game allows your dodge to go through even if you are very slightly late on the dodge. This is the difference between a game letting you know that you messed up versus you calling it BS. And you will constantly be calling BS, because you saw the tell from a mile away and you pressed dodge, but the attack still hits because you were slightly late. You can mitigate this somewhat by favouring pre-dodging than always going for perfect dodges. Which you should, as a perfect dodge does not offer much reward.3. Inconsistent attack timing/dodge window. The attack animations in this game versus their dodge window is inconsistent. There are attacks where the hit registers once you see it visually, and there are some that are ""late"", meaning the hit only registers much later after the attack animation. So you're constantly relearning the dodge timing of each and every attack. Combined with 2., it makes a very frustrating experience even within Souls-like.4. You can be stun locked. There are many attacks in the game with rapid combos, but you can't dodge out of the stagger from the attacks. Meaning if you get hit, you're eating the ENTIRE combo's damage. Combined with the previous points, it makes it even worse.This game has VERY high production values, and everything about it is 10/10. But I would give the combat 5/10. The story, writing, and production are the ONLY things that kept me from refunding this game and the rewards are worth the punishment.

448,"A guaranteed GOTY at this point.Truly a masterpiece of a game. It has its flaws, but for a game that came out in 2024, it runs decently, plays well, and provides a decent amount of challenge while not entirely holding the player's hand.As an ethnically Chinese person, I think that this game has stepped leaps and bounds in terms of showing the world what China is able to create, while sharing Chinese culture to Westerners at the same time.For those wondering if this game is worth the price, it 100% is, but there are definitely some pros and cons that I think are necessary to address.- Pros -Runs decently well (if you hardware isn't incredibly out of date. I played on an RTX 3070 laptop GPU)Amazing storyA TON of secrets, most you definitely will miss unless you watch YouTubeFun fighting mechanicsHigh amount of customization for buildsA lot of weapons and armor setsBeautiful graphics- Cons -Some bosses aren't too well designed (in terms of hitboxes and attack patterns, making the battles unnecessarily hard)Many secret areas/bosses can't be returned to if you missed themFrame rates are choppy at certain locations, especially water-abundant areasThe time exploring between bosses feels mostly shallow (there isn't much to do)Overall, despite the cons, I think this game does deserve GOTY when the time comes. I really look forward to seeing more Chinese representation in the gaming industry, as the Chinese have not usually been in the spotlight when it comes to large AAA titles. Who knows where Game Science and Chinese game developers will go from here; but I can only see a bright future for all of them.",Recommended,1351,46.1 hrs on record,Posted: November 8

You Pretty much get to be a monkey and be hated by the higher ups.. The music and story telling do a great Job Especially in Chapters 2 and 4 please note the game does have Replay Valuewith different endings..Environment was Really well Designed in Levels i found myself in Different Areas such As a forestDesert and snow..Your main weapon is a pole that Extends and changes with the skills you choose and build around.you get different abilities and powers which can change the way you fight.Cons.You will have to deal with Difficult bosses at the start of the game Early There is no Difficulty Slider at all so for people who are casuals at gaming this is the not the game for you go back to Pal-world or just get good and watch Walkthroughs or the game has friendly Facebook Community that will help you out.Sometimes i Experienced the Game Crashing during boss fights when using Abilities and powers but that was Quickly patched out and patches are quite large so Be prepared but the game was still worth it.The quest system wont hand hold you so don't expect it to. If you want to know which one it was it was Chapter 2 it had a lot of weather effects plus Boss effects and just overall had a lot going on so therefore it caused a crash.A Lot of people drag the game down over the games Difficulty get over it.When focusing on the main objectives, Black Myth: Wukong is about 35½ Hours in length. If you're a gamer that strives to see all aspects of the game, you are likely to spend around 66 Hours to obtain 100% completion.

470,"Perhaps I was too harsh with you.This game is quite competently made, beautiful visuals, excellent story, good combat, rewarding upgrade system and alot of really good side quests.It's problem however and what probably stops it from being my GOTY is the consistency.Very often you'll have a great time, awesome bosses, great cinematography, no bugs for hours, and the perfect amount of challenge.Other times you'll have large bosses that have a hit box the size of a pea that floats 10 feet off the ground so you can hit it. Leg bosses that you cant lock onto their legs so youre just awkwardly getting chip damage on their legs while getting hit by things you cant see because youre underneath them and the camera is trying to kill you more than the boss it.Some times the level design makes you think ""Wow this area is awesome, exploring it really makes me feel like im discovering cool secrets and bosses.""Other levels will make you think ""Why is there so much empty space and why does this level have branching paths behind branching paths behind branching paths behi.... and it feels like it never ends.

Tôi đang đặc biệt chú tậm tới trận đánh với Hoàng Mi lão quái và đánh cái con rồng qq Kang-Jin Loong. Sấm sét giật đùng đùng, nhìn rất phê và đã mắt.Tôi rất cảm kích Game Science vì đã tôn trọng nguyên bản của Tây Du Kýnhưng thay vào đó Game Science tập trung vào sự xây dựng mối quan hệ với Trư Bát Giới hơn. Người của tôi đang nói là Thiên Mệnh Nhân ấy. Nghe ngầu thiệt sự haha. Đó là nhân vật mà bạn sẽ được đóng vài vào. Một con khỉ vô danh cũng xuất sứ tù Hoa Quả Sơn, y chang ông tổ của nó luôn :))Về cốt truyện, tôi có thể cảm kích khi họ có 1 xíu những tình tiết biến thể tạo kịch tính cho câu truyệnVề nhạc: quá hấp dẫn và cuốn, tât cả mọi âm thanh và nhạc đều rất đỉnh. Có nhửng lúc còn bật những bài remix từ phim Tây Du Ký từ năm 1986 cơ. Mọi bài đều được đầu tư và chau chuốt tỉ mỉ, tôi nghĩ cũng có phần CEO Game Science là 1 nhạc sĩ. Nên tác phẩm của ông có phản ánh ra được điều đó.Một khi mà âm nhạc hòa quyện với hiệu ứng và cảm xúc coi Tây Du Ký như khi còn bé. This game will literally take you back to your childhood. It's awesome. But beware, bạn có thể cần phải ""học bài"", trong lúc khi chơi. Để hiểu rõ thêm về cốt truyện, và những nhân vật trong kiếp nạn mà bạn đang vượt qua. Đối với mình thì mình phải coi thêm ông Dũng CT, Asmongold, và nói chuyện với ChatGPT để có thể hiểu, cảm và thụ được hết tinh túy của game hơn :)))Thôi tôi nghĩ tới đây là đủ dài cho 1 review game trên Steam rồi.

As a gamer, this is a decent game with good combat and level design. Couple minor gripes: some bosses are unbalanced being insanely difficult (like Yellow Wind Sage) that made me feel defeated not motivated to keep going; some environmental textures are low res and really pull you out of the immersion; invisible walls are annoying too. Lastly, I don't know why the discussions surround this game become political: it is a retelling of an ancient story starring animals that is so deeply embedded in Chinese culture and I don't know why it needs to be ""inclusive and diverse"" or why it has to do with ""the Chinese government"" or ""Covid-19""",Recommended,686,52.8 hrs on record,Posted: November 8

That's not a bad thing and I like the challenges, but sometimes the boss fights are just unfair and you cant even touch them. Some of the bosses are really dumb and just spam overpowered attacks. There is one fight in chapter 6 where the boss just keeps spawning tornadoes and freezing you and it's almost unplayable. I'd love the bosses if they weren't just spamming crazy attacks the whole fight.

The game is really nice sure, but the second time over, the charm isn't the same anymore.

I feel extremely blessed as a native Mandarin speaker. This review is probably biased and I don't care.What I appreciate the most about this game is its focus on pure, unadulterated fun. There's no DEI, politically correct BS — just rich and diverse characters, intricate stories that touches your heart, challenging gameplay that keeps you hooked from start to finish.One of the standout features is the boss fights. Each encounter is unique and some are very challenging, requiring different strategies and showcasing the game's impressive design and creativity. There are 107 unique boss fights!!! The attention to detail in these battles is remarkable, making each victory feel incredibly rewarding.Last but not least, the music and voice acting (in Mandarin) is amazing. For example, Bajie's voice is exactly how I remembered him from childhood memories.I purchased the deluxe version as soon as it was available. I want to support the developer because they not only said NO to Sweetbaby Inc., but also delivered an excellent product for the amount of resources they have. Sure, there are some areas that needs improvements. For example, there are too many invisible walls. Chapter 6 feels incomplete. But it doesn't matter! This is a game for nostalgia, a game that gets you interested in Chinese culture, a game that should be the GOTY no matter how IGN manipulates the vote.",Recommended,1331,86.5 hrs on record,Posted: November 7

548,"I will be honest I did enjoy the art direction of this game and the secret boss was incredible but I don't think the gameplay is super polished. I've played a fair share of souls likes, hack and slashes, and difficult rpgs but no game has made me reach the level of frustration that some wukong bosses have made me feel. While people could argue that certain bosses are skippable and you're not forced to fight most bosses in the game the experience in chapter 1 of the game with wandering wight just disappearing made me feel as if I had to knock my head into a wall and defeat a boss as soon as i encountered it or risk losing some important drop. Also the bosses i had the hardest time with were not hard because their attack patterns were particularly difficult but because they had awful hitboxes, or the arena was small and cluttered, or because they had minutes of invulnerability that did not have an obvious counter. If the studio made a wukong themed animated series or tv show I think their talents may be better used because the most redeeming part of this game was the incredible art style and unique interpretation of the journey to the west characters.",Not Recommended,955,42.5 hrs on record,Posted: November 7
549,"This seems to be a great game that being said It is only because the standards for what a great game is has dropped compared to years before.Im not really captivated by the story so far, because there really isn't any story. This is a boss fight game and that's about it. Nothing more. If you see it as that, you may enjoy it but if you are looking for a story to captivate you, that you can feel part of, this isnt it.Additionally, the choice to not include a difficulty setting really is a confusing one as most of the bosses in this game (e.g White clad noble are very difficult to beat most times having to retry upwards of 10,20,40 times to beat them.) Additionally, there's no option to skip some bosses. On my end, the game is broken for me as I cant justify sitting down trying to beat one boss for 5+ hours. If you cant spend upwards of 5 hours grinding to beat a boss, I cant recommend this game for anyone that has other things to do besides gaming.",Not Recommended,776,5.7 hrs on record,Posted: November 7

It does get repetitive but that's combat in most any game, the combat is almost always fun and engaging with this game so it doesn't feel stiff.Every boss, every enemy, all of the lore and dialog, all of the beautiful scenes and fighting cinematic scenes that just kept getting better. There's so much about this game to go on about with why it was a great game but I'll leave it with the following; if you want a game that genuinely respects your time, and makes you feel like you're engaged in a story that will give you a challenging fight with some absolutely gorgeous views and scenes then pick this game up, if not at full price I'd 100% say on a sale.",Recommended,932,68.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 6

I finished the game 3 times thinking that it would be more than enough to see everything, but without checking the internet it's nearly impossible to discover everything, very easy to miss something on the way.Also when you play the game for the first time it's extremely difficult.

648,"Pros:- Decent enemy and boss design- Jaw-dropping graphics and environments (only sometimes for the latter)- Abilities and transformations are fun to use- Animations are great- Authenticity to the source material is spot on- Cutscenes are kino af- Fairly satisfying character progressionCons:- The worst performance in a game I have ever played (yes I have played modded ARK survival before, this game is worse for it, even on a 4060)- Silent protagonist. I wanted the goofy voice at the start to be my monkey's voice for the whole thing. What a tease- Player light attack combo is way too short for the long and frequent attack windows. Way too repetitive- Every boss gets fought the exact same way- Next to no worthwhile build diversity- The worst level design I've seen in a game- 130GB (need I say more?)- £50 (need I say more?)- Ruined my sleep schedule with nightly gooning sessions to the goth spider lady's r34On a serious note. Unless a game is full on GOTY material or offers hundreds of hours of replayability, or a truly iconic story that you just have to experience, then I can't recommend anything for this price with this big of an file size. The game is just too spectacularly mid. Money doesn't grow on trees, and its even harder to come by in this economy. On top of that, as you get to midgame, the fights get boring and the level design becomes terrible, especially since there's no maps or markers. This game will probably get game of the year for a reason I cannot at all understand, it wont get my vote, none of this years games probably will (maybe S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2)Is it a good game? Sure.Is it optimised? Not at all.Is it worth the price? Not even half the price, I've seen 10 times better for half the price.Cons outweigh the pros, only buy this game if its ever 80% off.

675,"In the recent years rarely have I got a game in which I just don't want to stop playing no matter how busy I am or how much work I have pending.This game is not flawless but it hits each and every mark that makes a game FUN for me. I am a Souls like snob so the combat was appealing to me even though it's not that hard (for the most part), but what sold me were the visuals and the presentation that this game encapsulates beautifully.The story is told through these gorgeous cut-scenes with superb art styles that convey the happenings and the past at the start of every chapter. Each of the story feels even better than the previous one and the characters and events represented in these are the highlights. The story and characters's lore goes very deep and is a great introduction to those who want to know more about The journey to the west.All that said no matter what, at the end of the day it is a game and as far as gameplay goes it is a very fun, mildly challenging and very rewarding game. It takes a bit of time to get used to the mechanics and just to the sheer quantity of them. The abilities are fun and the variety between enemies especially the bosses keeps this game always interesting. I feel like I'm a child again playing Dark souls 1 not having a clue what's around the corner and using 10 items just in sheer excitement and fear about what's to come next.Conclusion- For me it's an 8.5/10. If it didn't have some hiccups and performance issues it might have gone to a 9.

717,"Extremely fun monkey simulator. You go around with a stick and pound yaoguai to dust. There are 4 methods to mastering your stick: overhead wack attack, getting pegged by the stick, poke, and the GOAT stance (spoiler). Also there's a variety of spells such as Force hold, sea bear circle, invisibility, getting rock hard, shadow clone jutsu and minecraft totem of undying. Lastly, this game is focused around perfect dodging instead of using shields or parrying (unless you use a lot of rock solid). These skills along with mix & match weapon and armor drip AND the ability to respec your levels, you can try out many different play styles throughout the game or even if you're stuck on a boss. Occasionally there are some yaoguai you can capture with your gatorade bottle to be used in combat. My favorites are big forehead guy (for big beefy damage) and horse with electric whip (for showing them who's master). It's insane how there's 100+ bosses in this game. Boss difficulty ranges from Wants to be Dominated to Will Dominate You. Really hated that last guy at the end though, he used the Force and drank my gatorade. 9.5/10, the between chapter animations were peak. Honestly should be 2024 Game of the Year with this kind of quality.",Recommended,1025,58.4 hrs on record,Posted: November 5
718,"It's fun and challenging. The feel of the game is charming and the Chinese mythology gives it a distinctive flavor unlike most American or Japanese titles.Though it's Souls-like in many respects it has it's own approach to fights which set it apart. The lack of a shield or parry greatly changes the combat. Unlike say, Elden Ring, where a builds core sequence can be used in 80% of encounters without much thought and tough fights are mostly based on mitigating or avoiding damage, Wukong must use his entire arsenal and master each execution, study opponents and their timing, tailor his gear to the challenge, AND avoid or mitigate what is coming at him to proceed through any significant obstacle.

The story presentation was impressive, its direction unpredictable, and the beautiful animations between chapters added incredible depth to the storytelling—truly the cherry on top.Gameplay is smooth, complex, and holds up to the best action-combat games. The bosses were unique, with plenty of mob variety and great mechanics.The difficulty is on the easier side compared to the hardest modes in God of War or the Elden Ring DLC bosses. However, the challenge ramps up nicely, with the top three most difficult bosses comparable to those games. Replay value is high as well; you can speedrun the game after completing it once, and NG+ introduces a variety of builds. NG++ also adds enough difficulty to make 100% completion satisfying.The maps are beautiful, and the overall graphics and spell effects are some of the best I’ve seen in a while. The only downsides are the map design, which can be confusing, invisible walls that hinder natural exploration, and brightness imbalances that create pitch-black zones alongside overly bright scenes due to the implementation of global illumination for raytracing.Strongly recommend.",Recommended,1119,68.7 hrs on record,Posted: November 5

779,"Really enjoyed this game and got into it not knowing anything about it. But its not exactly a souls like as you don't lose anything. Combat is fun and although it does get repetitive at times (light attack until full focus, then heavy), you can create some decent builds. I used a poison build that melted some of the later enemies.There's a lot of bosses and side bosses that it almost feels like a boss rush mode at times. The levels themselves are cool but the level design could use a map for sure. Some areas like chapter 3 were annoyingly long. There's also a lot of dead end walls at times when you are trying to explore. Aside from this they were all pretty interesting to explore as they have side paths that lead back. The lack of monuments or structures to decipher where you are could have also helped as some levels look very similar throughout.Overall I think it was a great game for a dev team's first title. Looking forward to the DLC and I really enjoyed the fluidity of the spells and transformations as well as the ability to instantly respec. Only other thing I'll mentions is I didn't quite understand the story. Requires you to know the Journey to the West or be familiar with the lore about that. So I had to stop and try to do some research on that to get a better idea of what the story and cinematics were trying to convey.",Recommended,1098,81.2 hrs on record,Posted: November 4

I, like most others, figured I'd bide my time and see if it panned out on release. What we ended up getting is a surprising hit.Pros:* Rides the line between Souls-lite and Spectacle Fighter with its flashiness and cooldown abilities.* Gracefully adapts Journey to the West to the archetypal Souls game plot.* Absolutely gorgeous.* Tons and tons and tons of interesting bosses.* Offers enough abilities to allow for varied combat.* Cliffs aren't dangerous... until they are. The game usually doesn't let you fall off a cliff by any means, but on occasion there are deadly falls despite that.* Very demanding on my high-ish end hardware (see my profile for specs). Frequently dips from 60s to the 40s. Without DLSS I'd probably be screwed.",Recommended,712,20.5 hrs on record,Posted: November 4

From defeating all 107 bosses & discovering all items/weapons/skills, to all the characters & stories that at points even brought me to tears. It gave me such an appreciation for Chinese Mythology, even going as far as getting me to read excerpts from Journey to the West & discussing the stories with friends of mine that grew up in China and knew this story from their youth.Without giving anything else away, and if you are hesitant on jumping into this game.

860,"Black Myth Wukong ReviewBmw is just one of the best singleplayers in 2024, definitely a GOTY for me. It's just a well-crafted labor of love game. It's rich culture and mythology make the game feel more dramatic and atmospheric in each area and bosses. It's soul-ish vibe makes the game more tense yet it has its own uniqueness, and it's combat is very fluid yet simple RPG elements. Every character, NPC,enemies and boss is very well crafted on its heart. Plus the graphics are insanely good, like every penny spent is well spent. Every chapter has its own unique ending and morals, which I really like to dive deep into Chinese mythology. The only cons I see are the lack of replayability, which 2–3 new games plus can be boring and tiring. Also lack of combos for me, but it is only optional but still fluid and satisfying combat with different kinds of skills and abilities.Overall it's a solid 10/10. It's a masterpiece game.",Recommended,766,68.1 hrs on record,Posted: November 3

I turned off the cheats and now im stuck on the next boss, idk how this happened but this game is the hardest game ever made imo. im sad and my pride is hurt, this game made video games un-fun for the first time in 20 years of gaming be my hobby.

864,"What can I say that already hasn't been said? The game is a masterpiece and everyone should play it, especially those who are looking for a challange. However it is not perfect, and I've seen the perfect short description for it. A flawed masterpiece. There are little things that should be changed, like a map would be really useful, because sometimes you think you can explore the area in front of you, but it's just an invisible wall.I enjoyed this game a whole lot throughout my playthrough, but I always had that feeling of emptiness when just travelling through areas, and that is my biggest problem here. The areas that connect the amazing story and amazing bossfights are just bland. It doesn't have the magic that games like Fromsoftware makes does, which is okay, because I know this game is the first game that Game Science made (At least in this category).I think and strongly believe that if anyone has any critique or problem with this game, they will look at it and improve it in DLCs or mabye in a sequel. This is such an amazing studio, the fact that they made this game like this and what it is after only making a strategy game (Art of War: Red Tides), it's just incredible. They deserve every bit of praise and every bit of success in the future, because Wukong is just an experience that everyone should go through. Thank you for making such an amazing game, in the world of microtransactions and now 70-80 dollars per title, that comes out buggy unfinished and just bad or bland the whole way through, you guys made an amazing, interesting, beautiful, complete and bug free experience, which runs amazing too.Thank you Game ScienceThis review was intended to be just one word: monke",Recommended,1404,48.8 hrs on record,Posted: November 3

Even without the nostalgic memory it gives me it still has some of the best voice acting and one of the funnest combat I've ever experienced. Overall the one thing that the game don't do very well is the lip-syncing sometimes it feels like they didn't even try to get it to match. Because that is my only complaint about the game I think its pretty fair to say that this is the best game of 2024. 10/10 could not recommend this one enough to people that like action games.,Recommended,537,51.8 hrs on record,Posted: November 3

The caracters are exceptional.Because i have been a long time fan of the monkey king series (the older series) i was a little disappointed in the story.

908,"Black Myth: Wukong is a pretty interesting game. The combat is fun and the game does a great job at making you feel extremely powerful. Bosses are for the most part also fun to fight and while many are pretty forgettable the good ones both look and feel absolutely incredible. The story is quite enjoyable as well and is told in a pretty interesting way. At some points it can be a bit confusing, but for the most part things make sense and it does not feel like things are meant to be 100% clear either so this is not really a downside.The main issues with this game unfortunately comes to certain bosses. For whatever reason a few bosses just have horrible hurtboxes where attacks will just go straight through their body from certain angles. You can always get to them from some angle, but it just feels terrible to deal with. I also think the game could be zoomed out a little bit as for some bosses the best place to look is at the very edge of the monitor. These issues can make certain areas feel awful to go through, but the game certainly has enough incredible segments for me to say it's still for sure worth playing.",Recommended,918,53.9 hrs on record,Posted: November 3
909,"Easily the most beautiful game I've ever seen, especially on my 49"" widescreen. As beautiful and enjoyable as the game is to play, it's also one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, and I've lost track of the amount of times I've wanted to smash my fist through that 49"" widescreen. It took me 15 hours just to get past the first chapter. Chapters two & three were much, much easier, and I've now hit a wall at the end of Chapter four. So much so that I need to play something different for a bit because my blood pressure is shooting through the roof.For those on the fence about buying this game; while you may think I gave this a thumbs up by mistake, I assure you, I did not. It may be one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, but it's also one of the best. I absolutely suck as these souls-like games, and I may be stuck at the moment, but I've been having a blast the entire time.My only wish would have been for this to be more of an open world. I had a hard time with a bunch of different things in Elden Ring, but thankfully it being open world, allowed me to go do other things, get stronger, then come back. Unfortunately, some of the chapter regions are fairly large with lots to do, but eventually you get bottlenecked.",Recommended,1015,56.2 hrs on record,Posted: November 3
910,"Honestly game of the year for me. I think some people are coming into this game with an expectation of it being a ""souls like"". While there are some souls like qualities about it, I would say this game feels like the newer versions of God of War. The combat is simple but allows you to mix it up and every hit feels great. They make it incredibly easy to re-spec your character stats so you can try out multiple skill paths and builds without multiple sessions. The animations that play after every chapter are beautiful (chapter 4 is my favorite) and there is a rich story. What are the cons though? Invisible walls are a huge thing in this game. You have such well made and beautiful landscapes, but it can be confusing on where you can go and where an invisible wall will block your path. Chapter 6 feels almost like a tech demo of the developers wanting to see what it would look like if the game is more open world. The invisible walls thing is more visible in chapter 6 as well. Also as of writing this, there is a secret quest in chapter 4 that is the only one you can not do if you have already beat the chapter so be on the look out for that. I would say if you want the best ending for this game PLEASE do the secret ending. It is huge and bombastic and everything I expected from the ending of this game. Overall I would give this game a 9/10 almost reaching a 10. I can not wait to see what this studio comes out with next!",Recommended,1156,50.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 3

Fighting system and lore in game are stunning, is not a new messiah of soulslike gaming but 3 stances, transformations, dodges in perfect time and skills give strong fast gameplay with many bosses and minibosses which makes you want more and more. 80% off bosses aren't a challenge, but rest could appear in productions of FromSoftware because they are so epic. I like a way of show us a Chinese culture, beliefs and traditions with myths and old legends that came from ""Journey to the West"", especially in the journal entries. I want to see more games like this from Asian developers. Only one thing that i disslike are openworld locations in act 3 and especially in act 6, where are many empty places.

948,"Black Myth: Wukong has set a new standard for action RPGs, drawing on a profound cultural legacy and pushing boundaries with stunning visuals, complex gameplay, and a captivating story. As a longtime fan of both gaming and Chinese mythology, I was blown away by how seamlessly it brings the legend of Sun Wukong to life. Here’s a breakdown of why this game deserves a solid 5 stars.1. Unparalleled Visuals & AtmosphereFrom the moment the game starts, it's clear that Black Myth: Wukong is something extraordinary. The environments are incredibly detailed, whether you're navigating foggy bamboo forests, fiery pits, or serene mountaintops. Each setting feels meticulously crafted, immersing you fully in the world of Chinese folklore. The lighting, weather effects, and particle details are all top-notch, giving the game a cinematic quality that I’ve rarely seen matched. I played on a high-end PC and the graphics honestly blew my mind—this is definitely a next-gen experience!2. Deep and Engaging Combat SystemCombat in Black Myth: Wukong feels both intuitive and challenging. It’s not your typical hack-and-slash affair; there’s a rhythm to it, and each enemy has unique patterns and weaknesses that encourage you to strategize rather than just brute force your way through. You have access to a wide array of abilities and transformations, which add depth and variety to how you can approach battles. The developers clearly drew inspiration from both traditional action RPG mechanics and classic Chinese martial arts choreography, making each fight feel like an intricate dance.3. Faithful Representation of Chinese MythologyThe game’s biggest draw, of course, is its basis in Journey to the West. Black Myth: Wukong takes the core of this legendary tale and expands it in ways that are both respectful and inventive. It’s refreshing to see a major game studio dive into a story that’s often underrepresented in Western media, staying true to the source material while adding depth to Sun Wukong and the creatures he faces. The mythological creatures and demons are imaginative, sometimes terrifying, and beautifully animated.4. Thoughtful Storytelling & Narrative DepthThe story unfolds like a classic epic, blending action, drama, and philosophy in a way that’s rare in action RPGs. While you’re playing as the Monkey King, you’re not just mindlessly charging through enemies—you’re following a hero on a quest for enlightenment and redemption. The character interactions are thoughtful and nuanced, and there are moral and philosophical undertones that add depth to Wukong’s journey. The developers went beyond simply rehashing familiar tales, giving Wukong a sense of vulnerability and complexity that I wasn’t expecting.5. Top-Tier Audio & SoundtrackOne of the unsung heroes of this game is the soundtrack. The music is haunting, inspiring, and fits each scene perfectly. It draws on traditional Chinese instruments and motifs, while mixing in elements of orchestral grandeur, which helps elevate the atmosphere. Sound effects are equally impressive, from the clang of Wukong’s staff to the ambient sounds of the wilderness. Everything feels precise and purposeful.6. High ReplayabilityWith different abilities, transformations, and paths to explore, Black Myth: Wukong is a game that will definitely pull you back for a second playthrough. I’ve already started my second run, experimenting with different combat techniques and looking for secrets I may have missed. The difficulty is also adjustable, making it accessible to players of all skill levels, but for those who enjoy a tough, strategic experience, the higher difficulties are no joke!Final ThoughtsBlack Myth: Wukong is not just a game; it’s an experience. It’s a masterful blend of storytelling, artistry, and challenging gameplay, wrapped in a package that showcases the beauty of Chinese mythology. Every aspect feels intentional and polished, from the visuals to the music to the mechanics. It’s clear that the developers put a lot of heart and soul into making this game, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.Whether you're a fan of mythology, a gamer who loves challenging combat, or someone who just wants to see what the next generation of RPGs looks like, Black Myth: Wukong is an absolute must-play.",Recommended,3627,12.8 hrs on record,Posted: November 2

It’s like stepping straight into the Chinese mythology with Wukong himself (I know I know, he is/isn't the one). The visuals are insane, the gameplay is extremely addictive, and the challenges pull you right in from the start. It’s like you’re really on this legendary journey...The graphics are honestly something else. Every environment feels alive, from misty mountains to shadowy forests, and the enemies are so detailed they feel like they’re straight out of an old myth. The combat is buttery smooth, too. Every move and transformation just flows and making it so satisfying to play. You can tell the devs really poured their hearts into every detail of this world.The gameplay is as intense as it is rewarding. The combat is strategic, challenging, and never feels cheap. Wukong’s transformations and abilities are epic and add so much fun to the combat. Though you may have to try a few transformations at first to figure out which best suits you ;PHonestly, BMW feels like more than a game...it’s an experience all imho. It brings the old legends to life with a fresh twist that anyone can get into, and Western players like myself will find it especially cool and unique. I seriously can’t wait to see what else the devs have planned as they keep building on this.-- Conclusion ---------------If you’re into interesting myths, epic action gameplay, and jaw-dropping visuals, you have to play this one.10/10 on my list, no bs!",Recommended,1284,116.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 2

Hours spent trying to improve but I find, that unlike Elden Ring, I was getting bored running in the same areas just to level up. The mobs are pretty easy also and then the mini bosses / bosses are like 10 times harder so it feels like there's no way to practice on any stronger enemies. I think Id have a better time if there was a verity of challenging enemies and larger areas to explore but its very linear.

It's not nearly as punishing as dark souls/elden ring but if your a fan of that type of game then you should find at least some level of enjoyment out of this one, they share many parallels. The combat is a total departure from that genre tho in that its a bit more button mashy and significantly faster. You still need to learn enemy patterns, tactfully dodge, manage resources, upgrade equipment, explore and so on so you cant just go on autopilot. I honestly dont really have much in the way of negative things to say except for that you're going to NEED to consult a guide/tutorial of some kind otherwise you will miss out on tons.

Chapter 6 really threw me for a loop with a completely different approach to progress than previous chapters.Gorgeous to look at, ran like a dream on my machine, except for, oddly, the end credits, which had significant stuttering.I think the game is a little overly long to expect multiple playthroughs, but if you like that, there are several items that are New Game + only, just by virtue of the fact that they need more rare resources than exist in the game.I'm a slow, careful player, started using a guide somewhere around Chapter 4 as I realised I was missing a lot of content, and even then, there was some missable content I managed to bypass.Now, maybe some of this was due to my being wholly unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but there were story beats I found nonsensical or confusing. I suspect many of them are callbacks. The beginning of Chapter 2 made me feel like I had missed something, and I eventually had to just resign myself to ""Yep, okay"" whenever I encountered something odd.Go into it expecting a wild ride and don't ask too many questions, you'll have a good time.",Recommended,1075,68.4 hrs on record,Posted: November 2
988,"What you need to know about WukongI'm 16 hours in currently, and here is what you need to know.Black Myth: Wukong is a game you get for 3 main reasons:1. Because it's a ""souls-like"", meaning it has difficulty to its gameplay.2. The BEST and most STUNNING graphics you will find in a game to date .3. A COOL story that takes you through Chinese mythology.is a souls-like game, which has a decent difficulty level. The difference between Wukong and a game like Elden Ring, is in that Wukong feels a bit more like ""going from boss to boss"", since boss encounters are very close to one another. An importent note here, is that bosses in this game are cinematic masterpieces, and some of the most beautiful encounters I have long seen in a video game.Gameplay is also somewhat unique, since the main mechanic is to build up combo points using light attacks, in order to perform stronger instant heavy attacks. The game isn't about ""creating complex builds"", since combat is more straight forward. Instead it focuses a bit more on story and beautiful environments, rather than adding extra complexity to combat like what you might find in Elden Ring. You DO have builds, but they are pretty straight forward, which is great if you don't like ""insane complexity"".Also... The way you mainly avoid damage, is by dodging/rolling, which in this game feels slightly off occationally... I have played every major souls game out there, and for some reason in Wukong, you will often find that you press the dodge button perfectly, but because your current animation has to finish, you won't dodge.... So you WILL take damage, because animations gets in the way. :/I also wasn't expecting feeling like I was playing a movie... It is an ABSOLUTELY stunning game to look at, and looks photo-realistic in many areas. I can't stress enough HOW good this game looks, and YouTube videos doesn't do it justice. It's pyre eye'gasm to play through it's beautiful environments. And with story being an incredible element to what makes the game great, it is SUCH a joy to play through. It's obvious that they took advantage of Unreal Engine 5 for this game to achieve these levels of graphics.There is one downside though, from what I can tell... Your armor cosmetics are tied to ""armor stats"". ':D So if you REALLY enjoy customizing your appearances, then you won't really be able to, without also making yourself less strong... Hopefully they patch in the option of customizing your appearance later on, since you unlock SO many cool armors.Let's be honest here... MANY people support this game, because ""it took a stand against wokeness"" during its development, which in my book is a BIG plus as well! Wokeness is a poison that is ruining video games, and we need more developers who cater to GAMERS, rather than loud minorities who DOESN'T even play their games, and who seem scary because ""they scream the loudest"".That aside...The game IS an incredible experience, and I feel it is a 9/10 souls like game experience, and a 12/10 visual and cinematic experience! I can't stress enough how INCREDIBLE looking this game is, and how well optimized performance is.When I initially had interest in this game, I was afraid that the reviews were influenced by ""so mentioned anti-wokeness"", but having played 16 hours as of now, I can say without a doubt that this game is a masterpiece.Is Wukong perfect? No... There are minor things like invisible walls EVERYWHERE, and the game being very linear most of the time. I also only encountered one bug, after 16 hours of play, which made me loose progress, since I got stuck inside one of those invisible walls... But one bug in 16 hours is ""okay"". :)Now... I have a RTX 4070, so I am ""decently equiped"" to play demanding games. Currently with a mix between ""very high"" and ""cinematic"" graphics settings, I am getting between 80 - 110 fps... Which is VERY optimized imo.And for people who wanna dive into Raytracing, you can do that in this game, without the typical latency issues you might find in other games when you turn it on. Dunno if this is a bug or not, since I don't see much of a difference with it on or off, but turning it on only took away maybe 10 fps. :)",Recommended,3457,19.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 2

Fight sequences and (omg did I mention the cut scenes) … we’re talking movie/anime standard Absolutely epic!I’ve had the privilege of writing a review here as I’ve recently purchased it again on steam, mainly for my steam deck because I’mMore than happy to go through it again.No in app purchases, no micro transactions, just a big game which takes 100+ hours if played correctly.Like many others who have been on this journey, it is absolutely 100% Game of The Year!Well done game science, you guys have told the most beautiful and authentic version of Journey To The West.",Recommended,965,2.5 hrs on record,Posted: November 1
1014,"This is a complete and utter disappointment that is way overhyped.Paths or areas that you can explore look the same as those blocked by invisible walls. This results in you jumping against invisible walls about half the time, just so you don't miss any secrets. In each chapter, all the areas look very similar and there is no map, resulting in unnecessary loops through the levels.Combat is very flat and uninspiring. The developers seemed to think that a good combat system should have as many different aspects as possible, prioritizing quantity over quality. After an enjoyable, challenging boss fight in the early game, it got stale very quickly. Cooldown spam and light attacks combined with “seeing through the enemy” made all the bosses very easy and the boss fights quite similar.Then there’s a big dragon boss with the worst camera and hitboxes ever, this is an extremely atrocious fight. Finished it nonetheless but the next boss with lasers is almost as bad. Because of the lackluster exploration and boring combat, I have no intention of going through this horrible experience to keep getting disappointed.A lot of thought and passion went into the story, which shows. Unfortunately, the storytelling does not salvage the horrid gameplay experience. I really do not think this would receive half the praise it did if it wasn't based on a classic Chinese novel.",Not Recommended,1147,38.4 hrs on record,Posted: November 1

The camera control of this game is also quite bad, a lot of times I'm taking damage due to bad camera angle.

The one thing I was hoping for was a story/cinematic pleasing game such as is hinted at the beginning of the game but unfortunately 15 hours in and that intro was the most thrilling thing I got out of this game, by far.

Despite numerous Western journalists assigning it low scores due to their own corruption (if you seek hidden vices, follow the money), the sales figures tell a different story—numbers do not lie. Nowadays, I notice that to find a truly excellent game with challenging content and graphics worthy of the Unreal Engine 5, one must look towards the Asian market.For my part, I consider it the best game of 2024; it truly deserves its throne.""Caution: This is meant in a humorous tone despite the emphasis on freedom of expression.""",Recommended,907,26.3 hrs on record,Posted: November 1

1079,"A great heavy hitter from China offering a unique take on the soulslike landscape. It's a linear game with loads of secrets, optional bosses, and even a few secret levels. A unique combat system that takes getting used to, you're generally using your trickster spells to outwit the enemy and working towards a final hit from light atk, the seeing through mechanic, or spending focus points. This game shines with its constant boss fights. Many are pushovers, but there's plenty to see. Given the linear nature of the game, the game can almost feel boss-rush-y at times if thats up your alley. If you're not a fan or weren't impressed with a boss's moveset, chances are you'll find another one pretty soon anyway. Despite said linear nature, there's still plenty to explore.Glad I finally gave this a shot, I was a bit skeptical at first of the rave reviews but It's just a game that caught on. I don't think this game reinvents the wheel, but it was certainly damn good. A small bunch of transformations (a spell category that gives you a new moveset for a limited time), a handful of effective game changer spells, and a couple other various combat interactions make this game stand out.I do wish this game was maybe 20-30% longer, but it's already decently long when you're going for all meaty optional content anyway.

1135,"ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE.After 170 hours I still feel like this review is premature. I wanted to wait til I finished a couple new games plus runs, before writing a review. But after finishing one complete play through I felt compelled to write my review. This game is ABSOLUTE cinema. It is a pure Master Piece. In my humble opinion there are no other contenders for Game of the Year in 2024. Any GOTY nomination which leaves this game out is invalid. Wukong as a studio first release was impressive on it's own, for combat, story telling, cinematics, sound track. There are several triple AAA studios that don't even come close to the level of quality, artistic design and passion put into telling this games story. Boss design is so good and the game always gives a way to figure the fights out.This game not being fully open world is a complaint I heard alot and believe me when I say it takes nothing away from this game.I can't wait to see what Game Science does next.NB: Game can be demanding to run even on an RTX 4090.For the best optimization guide use Hardware Unbox guide, linked below:YouTube™ Video: Black Myth: Wukong Optimization, The Best Settings to Change on PC! Update: Finished NG+2 unlocked all abilities and all journal entries. NG+3 seems to be where you start to see boss difficulty increase.

1163,"""A nearly perfect masterpiece and work of art, an unmissable adventure in Chinese mythology, and a unique story that narrates themes of mission and growth, love and courage, breaking the cycle of fate, and fighting for the well-being of all!""""Black Myth: Wukong"" — 9.6/10""Black Myth: Wukong"" can be described as an exceptionally outstanding piece of art. Whether it’s the smooth combat experience, rich combat techniques, magical artifacts, diverse bosses, or the exquisite graphics and delightful music—everything is truly remarkable. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly one of the best games currently available!Combat Experience: 8.8/10In ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" players can switch between three different staff techniques at any time during combat. Each technique is suitable for dealing with various types of minor enemies, bosses, and larger foes. Additionally, there are multiple skills available, such as ""Stun Technique,"" ""Invisibility,"" and ""Boss Transformation,"" along with specific weapons designed to counter particularly challenging enemies.However, a minor drawback is that the game lacks pre-input commands, making the ""Counter"" mechanism dependent on the player's memory of boss attacks, quick judgment, and timing during strikes. This can make it difficult to trigger the ""Counter,"" and dodging may sometimes feel sluggish. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by replacing the staff with a spear.You can't help but admire how beautiful the music, in-game visuals, and chapter animations are, allowing players to immerse themselves in the mythical world of ancient China. If you have the budget, I highly recommend purchasing the upgraded DLC to enjoy the in-game music album!The story of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is primarily told through fragmented narratives. However, by reading the in-game background stories and combining them with the original novel ""Journey to the West,"" you will be amazed to discover that the game not only includes personal growth and struggle but also embodies the revolutionary spirit inherited from the predecessor (Sun Wukong), fighting to break the cycle and striving for the happiness, equality, and freedom of the common people. Additionally, by exploring each character’s background story, players can gain a profound understanding of the vast worldview set in ""Black Myth,"" including the greed, anger, love, and the true goodness of every monster, character, and deity.""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly a near-perfect piece of art and is well worth purchasing and experiencing!",Recommended,2158,122.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 30

1178,"Graphics: A Dream - like Oriental Mythological WorldThe graphics of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" are stunningly beautiful. From the lush mountain forests to the eerie caves, from the solemn ancient temples to the magnificent Heavenly Palace, every scene unfolds like a beautiful oriental painting before our eyes. The details are even more amazing. The veins of the leaves are clearly visible, and the textures on the ancient architectures are exquisitely fine, as if one can feel the traces of time. The lighting effects create an excellent atmosphere. Whether it's the morning sunlight penetrating the mist or the afterglow of the setting sun shining on the ancient stone statues, players feel as if they are on the scene. The modeling of the characters and monsters is even more lifelike. Wukong's flowing hair, bright - eyed look, and the strange forms and ferocious expressions of the demons all demonstrate an extremely high level of production. This graphical expressiveness not only successfully restores the oriental mythological world in our hearts but also endows it with new vitality.Sound Effects: An Immersive Auditory ExperienceThe sound design of the game is excellent. The soundtrack skillfully combines traditional oriental music elements. The melodious sound of the guzheng, the powerful drumbeats, and the ethereal sound of the xiao echo each other in different scenes. During combat, the exciting rhythm of the music perfectly matches the intense fighting actions, making the player's heart beat faster involuntarily with the rhythm, enhancing the tension and excitement of the battle. The environmental sound effects are also outstanding. The rustling of the wind through the woods, the chirping of birds and insects in the mountains, and the roar of the distant waterfall all create an incredibly real game world for the players. Every sound detail has been carefully polished and fits perfectly with the graphics, allowing players to immerse themselves in this fantastical mythological world, as if they can hear the whispers of the myth.Gameplay: Action - adventure with Both Depth and FunThe gameplay of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is rich and diverse, with an excellent action system as the core. Players can perform various cool moves when controlling Wukong. The Ruyi Jingu Bang is as handy as an arm's extension in his hand. The connection between light strikes, heavy strikes, and combos is smooth and natural, with a great sense of hitting. Every time the Ruyi Jingu Bang is swung, one can feel the transmission of power, and the feedback when colliding with enemies is real and strong. The transformation system in the game is a major highlight. Wukong can transform into various forms, and each form has unique skills and combat styles, adding more variability and strategy to the battle. In addition, the level design is ingenious. There are both puzzle - solving levels that require players to use skills and wisdom to break through and challenging combat levels. During the exploration process, players need to constantly discover hidden paths and collect items. The fun of exploration and the excitement of combat are intertwined, keeping players highly enthusiastic all the time.Plot: A Mysterious and Fascinating Mythological StoryAlthough the currently shown content is just the tip of the iceberg, the great potential of the plot can already be seen. The game features Wukong as the protagonist, embarking on an adventure in a mysterious and vast mythological world, and there seems to be a hidden secret behind it. From the clips, one can feel the depth and complexity of the plot. The ancient prophecies, mysterious forces, and Wukong's own destiny are intertwined, arousing players' strong curiosity. This plot based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese mythological stories has a profound cultural heritage. During the game process, players seem to be reading an excellent mythological novel. Each new plot is like turning an unknown page, attracting players to explore further.Cultural Connotation: A Splendid Presentation of Oriental MythologyOne of the greatest charms of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" lies in its profound cultural connotation. It presents traditional Chinese mythological stories and cultural elements to players in a new and modern way. The mythological figures, demons, and magic weapons that can be seen everywhere in the game all originate from classic works such as ""Journey to the West"", yet they have been innovated and expanded in the game. This inheritance and innovation of traditional culture allow players to experience the profoundness of oriental culture while enjoying the game. It is not just a game but also a window to show Chinese culture to the world, enabling players all over the world to appreciate the unique charm of oriental mythology.",Recommended,4050,42.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 30

1190,"Playing Black Myth: Wukong feels like getting invited to an epic dinner party where the host serves you gourmet Michelin star food... but punches you in the face between every course.This game is unapologetically soulslike in the best (and worst) ways: No map. No easing in. No hand-holding. Just pure, unrelenting punishment with a side of ""Oh, you thought you were doing well? Boss almost dead? HAHA UR DED.""But somehow, like a moth to a flame, you keep coming back for more—gritting your teeth (and probably shouting at your screen), fully aware you're flying straight into disaster.Visually? It’s a masterpiece. This game doesn't just look good; it feasts on your eyeballs with jaw-dropping graphics that make every leaf, fur texture, and spell effect shimmer with life. The storytelling is original, weaving Chinese mythology with a dark, mysterious edge. It’s a joy to experience something this polished and creative from a new studio, and it’s clear they put work into every detail. Right down to the moments where you die for the 100th time.If you're into games that hurt so good, Black Myth: Wukong will be right up your alley. If not, well... good luck.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of souls-like games. Its in a similar vein but also much more forgiving. That being said some of these fights were BRUTAL!

1197,"After investing almost 100 hours into Wukong, I can confidently say it’s been an unforgettable experience. I’ve completed all the achievements, and this game has pushed my limits in ways I never expected.From the very beginning, I was struck by its challenging gameplay. It’s definitely a hard game, but that’s part of what makes it so rewarding. I found myself really struggling with the first boss, the Whiteclad Noble. With limited options for my suit and no medicine left, I felt stuck and frustrated. However, overcoming that challenge made the eventual victory so satisfying.As I progressed, I encountered even tougher foes. The Tiger Vanguard (the one in blood pool) in Chapter 2 pushed my skills to the limit, requiring me to adapt my strategy and learn from my mistakes. Then there was the Yellow Loong in Chapter 4, which introduced a whole new level of difficulty with its unique mechanics. Finally, Erlang in the last chapter was a true test of everything I had learned, combining speed and power in a way that kept me on my toes.The combat mechanics are incredibly satisfying, and the sense of progression is palpable. Unlocking new abilities and finding ways to combine them for devastating effects made each victory feel earned. The game balances difficulty and fairness beautifully, which kept me coming back for more even when I faced tough challenges.The visuals are stunning, and the art direction really enhances the overall atmosphere. The environments are rich and varied, drawing you into the lore and culture that inspired the game.Overall, Wukong is a must-play for anyone who enjoys a tough challenge wrapped in a beautifully crafted world. It’s a game that tests your limits but rewards you with an incredibly fulfilling experience. I can’t recommend it enough!",Recommended,1496,91.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 30

1219,"I really liked the overall of the Game. But a big downside of this hole Game are the bosses, and no I am not complaining about the difficulty, I am someone who loves souls like Games but this one had some very buggy bosses, where sometimes it was just luck based. And what I absolutely hate are programmed definitive hits which you can't dodge or parry but those were for like 2 bosses not more. What I really think destroyed my experience is that at the end they made the player succeed more than 4-5 bosses one after another. At least in souls--like games from Fromsoftware you were nicely awarded by a new region, new weapons, new armor, new playstyle each time you beated a boss but here the ony reward I got was one Skill point and armor and weapons only for World bosses that wouldn't even be usefull in the final chapter and certainly not in the endboss fight. It's like having done all I have done before was useless and without any reason other than farming Skill points which you would get more than the double by just killing some foes.Yes the game has a lot to offer from story to grafik and secrets. I loved it. Even tho I encountered some serious stuttert in the cutscenes of chapter 4 (I have a 4070 Super and a Ryzen 7 7800 3xd)Overall I can only say that my experience wasn't rewarding enough and I feel like having wasted my time other than having experienced a good story but I could of have watched it on youtube instead.",Not Recommended,1173,23.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 30

1228,"This game truly stands out with its impressive graphics, making it a visual treat from start to finish. It's one of those rare titles that kept me thoroughly engaged, thanks to a well-balanced difficulty that never felt overwhelming but still challenging enough to hold my interest. The variety of enemies, immersive storyline, and thoughtfully crafted level design elevate the experience, making this a must-play. Performance was solid overall, and while frame generation has unfortunately become the standard, it was seamlessly integrated and hardly noticeable, ensuring smooth gameplay throughout.",Recommended,513,52.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 30
1229,"Steam really needs a neutral button.I was really hyped for this game since I saw the first trailer idk how many years ago and they were very careful not announcing dates and such so that they could work more on the game and deliver the best experience possible so I think my expectations were aligned with what was promised.The game stutters a bit, but nothing critical and usually goes by fast. Combat sadly didn't feel as fluid to me as I was expecting, the timing for everything seems to be off by a few miliseconds. Like the dodge doesn't work as soon as I press the button but a bit later than that (yes, even outside of combos - I'm fine with having to finish my combo animations to be able to dodge) and the switch between light and heavy attacks also feel a bit off with the timing.But the diary with the yaoguai's lore? Loved that, always wanted to get to know more about it! The literature part is just fantastic.I'm giving up after 40-ish hours on the game and finishing the third world.

And you discover that growing licorice might occasionally drop a goat skull just when you think you're beginning to get it. Feel free to attempt to understand that. Dating a dominatrix is similar to this. It's going to punish you, but it's visually stunning—the graphics are truly wonderful. The challenge, the rich mythology, and the game itself all drew me in, despite the fact that I was a newbie to this genre and was getting crushed. I nearly uninstalled it more times than I can remember, and I laughed and got angry. However, after countless long hours, discovering the secret ending, and completing New Game+again, I finally earned that Final Fulfillment achievement.

1239,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a visually stunning action RPG that brings Chinese mythology to life, letting players experience the legend of the Monkey King, Sun Wukong. By Unreal Engine 5, the game offers incredible graphics with detailed creatures and gorgeous landscapes that set a new benchmark for visual quality. The combat is polished and engaging, blending fast, tactical action with Wukong’s unique skills like shape-shifting, stealth, and elemental magic, plus different stances that allow for a flexible playstyle. The boss fights are a real highlight, with each one bringing unique moves and challenges that make battles feel exciting and rewarding. For those looking to explore even further, optional bosses provide extra challenges and rewards, adding depth to the game. With its amazing graphics, satisfying combat, and epic boss fights, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play for action RPG fans and anyone wanting a rich, myth-inspired adventure.

1280,"You will spend the vast preponderance of your frustrating time fighting bosses. The game might as well be called boss ladder. Of all the hours you will spend playing 90% of it will be dying on repeat to bosses while you try to memorize their move sets.The game offers a little filler between bosses, and that filler is insignificant. The RPG elements feel mostly worthless, and while the skills you learn will be needed as you progress, the fights themselves demand skill and move set memorization more so than anything else which just turns into hours of time in memorizing something you immediately forget as you progress past each boss.I love the combat, the mechanics, smooth, fluid, beautiful animation and graphics. But for me it is spoiled in the painful repetition of combat failures as you fight the same boss over and over and over hoping to either get lucky or get better. Not exactly a relaxing way to end your day.For many this is what you are looking for. For me, like many souls games, the challenge comes with cheese. You can save yourself tens, maybe hundreds, of painful frustrating hours, in unfun time by giving it a pass. Not to mention saving 60 bucks. Somewhere along the lines video games wanted to become punishing and not fun or relaxing. If that is what you want than this is it.",Not Recommended,1076,15.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 29

Eats SSD space and delivers a strangely unsatisfying combat experience in the very early game with an unrewarding skill tree to start with as well. Can only speak for the very early game experience but it was just extremely boring basic enemies that fall over like paper, not especially responsive attack chaining, no interesting combos, no parry, mediocre stamina system, extremely clunky heavy attack buffering. Also the game looked like it had forced motion blur with no setting to turn it off. Didn't like any of the characters in it at all either.

1320,"Honestly, one of the best games to come out this year. Maybe the best. There is a lot of something most other games just don't have anymore: VARIETY! Different armors with different attributes, weapons with different attributes (although there is only 1 weapon type) and 3 different stances. Tons of enemy variety, and A LOT of boss enemies! Some spells, a bunch of transformations, and a load of smaller equipment to tweak your play-style to your liking. The bosses are hit and miss difficulty wise, I would say that if you're an avid gamer, and especially if you play a lot of boss rush games, that there are very few bosses that will give you a run for your money, but there are definitely a few challenging battles for everyone. The game is can be very stunning and I had no complaints about the graphical design or detail... BUT... The game isn't optomised very well. I have 64gb ddr5, a 7950x3d, a 4080super, and extremely fast storage, but this game saw contant dips that caused stuttering. Normally ran at about 120FPS on 4k, but would drop down to 60 out of nowhere and cause massive stutters, dropped down to 1440 and had an average of 140ish fps, but with drops to about 80fps constantly which didn't have as harsh of a stuttering effect as when I played on 4k, so I continued my adventure in 1440p, to me the game was absolutely playable, but I know people who wouldn't even bother playing a game that did this, and I think it's important to note. Another complaint, the game felt bloated to me. I like to complete as much as I possibly can in my first playthrough as I often never revisit titles because I have a massive back catalog of games I want to invest time in, and it took me about 90hrs to beat every boss in the game and do everything of note. For a fairly linear game that requires you to do almost all of it's content to get the ""true"" ending, it's just too much IMO. I could have probably shortened this time by avoiding overworld enemies, but I have the bad habit of kill everything that I come across, but yeah, my verdict on the content is that it is definitely a little bit bloated and could have used a bit of a trim.Overall, if you're into boss rush game, this is among the best with the only franchises topping it, of course in my opinion, being Monster Hunter and the Souls games (not that I would directly compare them, they are their own unique franchises with completely different playstyles), and I recommend you play this game as soon as you get the chance. If you aren't into boss rush games, but want to give it a shot anyways, I'd probably wait for a sale because this is a boss rush game through and through.",Recommended,2162,90.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 29

Got stuck for about 4 hours and a half on the White-Clad Noble, but we roll!As someone who never played any souls-like games + a player who likes to turn off their brains when playing games, I was quite scared of the difficulty getting into it. Turns out, yes, it's hella hard (I reiterate, 4 1/2 hours on a single boss in the first chapter lol), and you get your ass handed very easily. Did watch a few videos on how to beat certain bosses? Yes, but once you get into the rhythm of it (especially dodging), it gets easier, or at least, it feels like you are kind of getting somewhere. Reminds me a little bit of music or a dance when you're fighting.And while it's hard, it's very satisfying. I don't think the game is too hard. It takes patience yes, especially for a player like me, but not once did I want to quit the game. The fighting gameplay is complex and comprehensive, and you're able to tailor your fighting style for pretty much each boss.On top of that, the graphics are exceptionally good, the music is incredible, and the story, the lore.... perfect. I'd recommend reading the journal entries as you go through the game, especially after you defeat a character/boss because it gives you a lot of insights on the whole story and background/links of characters.Made the mistake of putting my game on my HDD, please just put it on your SSD, else it lags. It's quite heavy on the CPU so I'd just recommend checking the specs just to be sure.

1338,"Edit: I have changed my review back to positive - the problems with dodge seem to be fixed in the skill tree, and the issues with drinking from the gourd are fixed through gear. My only complaint is some slight awkwardness about where you can and can't dodge. Which I do hope gets fixed, but in general - isn't that bad at all. Amazing game. Worth $60 under the circumstances - though I wish I had picked it up cheaper, just because cheaper is always better. Either way, worth the cost. Beautiful graphics, amazing story, and really good gameplay.Getting pretty cool - I have to say, though, that I can't recommend the game in it's current condition for the price I was charged. Trying to get a refund, now.The biggest issue - while dodge seems to be fixed in the skill tree, healing from the gourd is completely broken... Also, the hit boxes on the bosses are terrible when it comes to dodging. You can't roll between their legs, it's very awkward how dodge works.I could live with the weird hit boxes, but the healing part is really annoying. It, just, comes to either - farm like crazy and get to be OP for bosses, or spam them until you get a lucky run. It really ruins the whole game play - which otherwise is pretty good. The game is amazing, great artwork and world. Story is fun. Just a well done game. Except without some fixes to the game mechanics, I can't justify spending $60 on it.Edit: Unfortunately, Steam has declined my refund request. I do hope they decide to fix these horrible, infuriating, game play flaws and I don't have to go on a mad rampage all over the internet review bombing it. The game is too good to be having these problems.",Recommended,1354,25.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 29
1339,"Breath of fresh air, great gameplay, beautiful graphics, interesting story and characters. There was only one thing I disliked, and that is having to farm certain enemies in order to get all the necessary items to 100% the game. The drop chances are pretty low and you can clear an entire chapter without those items dropping, which is incredibly silly for a singleplayer game. I had to spend half an hour farming one enemy to get his item in a New Game+, meaning i cleared that chapter twice on a single playthrough and I was still missing stuff.9,5/10 just for that.",Recommended,468,68.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 29

1348,"This game caught my attention on launch day with its amazing visuals and awesome boss design. I couldn't wait to play it. I was a little nervous about the difficulty though to be honest. I have only ever played one Soulslike game prior to this. I know the studio persist that it's not a Soulslike but it really is in my honest opinion.I had played Sekiro before this but a couple of years ago. I really struggled with that but this I thought was the perfect level of difficulty. I don't know whether it's because it's more modern and has better mechanics but it just felt better. I am now intrigued to go back to Sekiro to compare.The boss design on this game is absolutely fantastic. Every time you come across another you're in awe at how mighty they are and the level of detail put into each one. The journal is very useful to track how many you've defeated and at first you're like omg... how is there this many!? But then when you get through them all you're yearning for more. I've defeated all but one of the bosses. I won't name them because of spoilers.The skills and abilities are very satisfying to use. Some of the spells aren't great but serve a purpose in some parts of the game.The lack of a map is my only gripe in any of these game genres. You have the fast travel ability from the shrines and that is all. Thankfully you can fast travel back through the chapters and areas after you've progressed to the next in case you missed anything. This is the same after completing the game so long as you don't start a New Game + save file. I'm currently back in my original save ticking off the bosses before starting NG+.I would highly recommend this game to anybody that's into this sort of genre. Even for those that aren't to be honest just to witness the visuals and boss design. Out of my 48 Hours, 30 of them were within the first three days of ownership. It's highly addictive because of how well made it is and also because it's non-stop action.BUY IT NOW!",Recommended,1608,55.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 28

The freedom is limited, but it is still fun to explore and just roam around. For me, the highlight of the game is the combat, and the exploration is just a breather from the grind. I think this will be a good starting point in building reflexes as you take on more challenging games.

1365,"It's a soul-like ARPG, so I'll talk about both the Action and the RPG parts.For the Action part, the combat is by itself hardcore and fun, but you can also make it more tactical (and easier) by taking advantage of the rich combinations of skills, spells, equipments, and weapons that the game offers. Whatever type of player your are, I'm sure you will find a playing mode that best suits your style.For the RPG part, the music and art are just top-tier and make the game really immersive. The story is a bit difficulty to understand, just like any other soul-like games. The storytelling is quite fragmented and non-linear. You will need to piece together information scattered across the map in order to understand the whole story, which is really deep and epic. At the end of each chapter (6 chapters in total), there is a short movie to tell the background the story. These movies are artistic too.The story is a dark adaptation of the book ""journey to the west"", one of the four most classic novels in China. Don't worry if you cannot understand the story at the beginning. Most players don't. In fact, as a Mandarin speaker who has thoroughly read the novel before, I don't understand the story either. Just look for some interpretation videos on YouTube and I find they explain the story quite well. If you are a fan of soul-like game, you probably are already familiar with this process.All in all, the game offers an epic journey for me, with fun and tactical combat, beautiful maps, engaging musics, and a fantastic story.

Some dialogs will give you important hints on how to defeat a boss.4. Take time choosing your spells and redistributing your skills before bosses and chapters.5. Perfect your perfect dodge.6.

1382,"I expected a run-of-the-mill, serviceable game that would occupy a couple weeks of my time. Instead I got one of the most soulful games I've played in years. The only reason this game isn't sitting comfortably at a 94 metascore is because it wasn't made by a Western dev team or a Japanese dev team that plays ball with Western media outlets. Often we hear about a game being short but offering great quality over quantity, or vice versa. Black Myth Wukong has both quantity as well as quality. I genuinely cannot believe a 60 dollar game offers so many unique interactions, mechanics, bosses, characters, hidden areas, items, all rendered with such painstaking detail, love, and care. In so many ways, this game is what I'd wished Wo Long Fallen Dynasty could have been. It feels like someone took Nioh 1 and 2 and then took them to the next level while refining them to a greater degree than what Fromsoft did when they made the jump from Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro to Elden Ring. Everytime you think you've seen all this game has up its sleeve, everytime you feel like you've taken the full measure of all it has to offer, it goes ahead and surprises you with more of some of the most lovingly crafted work ever put into a game.

The combat and lore was stellar and it looks WONDERFUL! Some points: You WILL die many times in this, but it is all about adapting, taking different routes and exploring. There are invisible walls. With the detail of this game into the environments I expected so. It can be annoying where there is a perfect picturesque area and you want to go there, or a spot that looks like a path you get greeted with running in place or staggering over the edge. It is so detailed it STILL looks like there is so much on the other side and it sucks you in. It was a very common thing in gaming so its not my first rodeo, but it shows how the game is so beautiful that it makes you want to access!-There is no mini map or any map in general almost as if you are the character looking at new lands and having to navigate based on landmarks dotted throughout or certain characteristics. This took time to work out and it can be frustrating. There are ways to get one however. A simple search will show you and it made a huge difference.-People claim it is a Souls-like. While it has some features associated, it is not. While boss enemies are numerous and powerful, You do not lose resources and you can upgrade and reuse talent points to change your playstyle at any time if you want to use a different strategy.. The save system and blocking is more forgiving as well. This IS challenging but given I am garbage at Elden Ring, me beating this after all of that was rewarding.

After some deliberation I bought the game anyway just to experience the excitement brought forth by a good quality game even though I may not have the ability to complete it. Glad that after 100+ hours of gameplay, I finally completed the game. And the experience is so good that I continue to complete the game 2 more times, and I just finished the NG+3 unlocking all great sage's ability.

But, beyond the eye candy, it just didn’t hold my interest.Let’s start with the gameplay and world design, which were a letdown. Despite Black Myth presenting itself as an adventure game, there’s little room for actual exploration. The world feels more like a set of gorgeously designed hallways than a place that breathes or invites you to get lost in. The lack of environmental storytelling or any kind of world-building narration makes it all feel somewhat hollow, especially when playing as a silent protagonist. It’s just you moving from one place to another, often with not much to do between fights.The combat, while flashy, feels repetitive after a while. The moves look cool, and it’s fun initially, but there’s not enough depth to make me want to go back for an NG+ run. There are moments where it feels satisfying, but it never reaches that level of addictiveness.On a brighter note, the story has some strong points, though I noticed some inconsistencies – particularly in Erlang Shen’s motives, which felt a bit forced at times. But overall, it’s interesting enough to keep you somewhat invested if you don’t mind the gaps.Black Myth: Wukong could be a fun experience for someone who mainly values graphics and spectacle over immersive exploration. However, as an adventure game, it feels like it misses the mark.

It is just a great game with a good price we are all waiting for.It is so good that I played through the game about four times in one go, and I got the Great Sage stand in my latest run, I’m still playing it and have yet to read all the bios that I collected.It is not as hard as any of the Souls games, but in a way it is way more fun when playing it.The only complain that I have with the game is the controller scheme is not customisable like a regular action game, some of the stories can be explained better for people who are not familiar with the Novel Journey to the West. If these issues were to be fixed it will be a solid 11/10.I absolutely loved all the animated cut-scenes, they are phenomenal.God job, what a game.",Recommended,774,145.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 27

1469,"Pros:Stunning visuals, enjoyable gameplay, and a compelling narrative drive this surprisingly lengthy game, packed with secret levels and many many boss encounters. While challenging, it's more forgiving than typical Souls-like games. The build customization is solid, but not overwhelming. The cinematics are exceptional, though the story may confuse those unfamiliar with Journey to the West mythology. The game is pretty damn huge as well!Cons:Some chapters feel like they drag on for too long, the invisible walls and the lack of a map can be frustrating, and some battles can be hit or miss (this game does abuse long wind-up animations, flying sequences, massive health pools and uninteractive mechanics for some of the bosses). The combat also feels unresponsive at times, but in general it's quite satisfying and action-packed. I would say the quality starts to deteriorate by the time you reach Chapter 3, and the game starts to become a little repetitive by then. Style over substance, I guess?Veredict:Overal, solid game for a good 60+ hours of fun (more if you want to complete everything in NG+). I would rate it an 8/10. One of the best games of the year for sure.",Recommended,986,61.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 27

1478,"Great game 10/10! This game is based on a Chinese classic so as an American going into the game not knowing the book(s) it is based off, I was a little lost at first as we are not the target audience. I did watch lots of videos explaining the original Journey to the West and the Legend of Wukong books to understand the lore and what story Game Science is trying to tell. I am a bit obsessed at this point lol. Besides the interesting story (after some research), the levels are beautiful and gameplay is super fun! The combat system is fun and requires you to adjust your strategy depending on the boss or your preferred style. I loved all the secret areas and it's almost mandatory to play the game at least twice to get the True ending. I really hope Game Science releases a sequel a la God of War style.",Recommended,655,110.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 27
1479,This is a visual masterpiece and top tier game play. This game deserves all the positive feedback it has gotten and needs MORE.

Sure boss are tough but if you pay attention to move sets and look at your gear you'll find sometimes a simple change in points or gear might make it easier.

1485,"Just finished platitumed the game in NG+. NG+ was a walk in a breezy park. I basically did a no-spell run, except for Erlang the scared divinity and Broken Shell of the Great Sage (those are on another level). The armour and weapon obtained towards the end of NG were that OP.I was playing on a Steam Deck @30fps. The game was so stable that in my ~60 hour play through, there was no crash whatsoever. And the game was so fun that it was like living in a dream.I cannot recommend the game more. Although I have done it twice, I am going to NG++ and so on, because there are so many possibilities that I want to try, so many mechanics that I have yet to perfect, see through being one of them. See through is satisfying as hell, and OP as hell. And other combinations of spells, martial arts styles, armour and weapons. I see hundreds more hours of fun.And the visuals in this game. I am not good with words. All I can say is that this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.Many have complained about the invisible walls in this game. It is not a perfect design. But I’ll take it any day, compared to inadvertently falling to death in Souls games.The game is not perfect. I will give it a solid 9.5/10. As a fan of action-adventure games, this is my GOTY.

1629,"Black Myth Wukong is a beautiful and complex game - telling one of the most unique and epic stories. However the adventure is marred with frame drops, stutters, graphicalglitches and some badly design bosses. Overall these reduce what would be a great score to a solid 7/10GraphicsThe graphics in Black Myth Wukong try to maximise the unreal 5 engine. As outlined in Digital Foundry's YouTube video, the game excels in advanced lighting, high res textures, complex shadows and special effects. Indeed, throughout the six chapters you experience a myriad of different areas which lean into some of these advanced features.For example the foliage within the forest is dense and beautiful, the sunlight streaming down touching the leaves while the canopies hide creatures and shadows. Another area sees you in a snowy wilderness, the snow glistening as the sun reflects off it. Overall, the RTX lighting system is providing a huge amount of graphical fidelity. Water effects are 2nd to none in this game, it is definitely some of the best I have ever seen. One of the biggest triumph is how special effects have been engineered to work well with real time action. With all the special effects on when you’re fighting some boss enemies, clouds wisp and whip up beside the staff while sparks and magic fly around your head casting shadows and illuminating parts of the character. This is by far probably the most complex and advanced I’ve ever seen these features taken in the game.The landscapes in Black Myth Wukong are incredible, you see vast expenses looking across great deserts and great Forest valleys, while also been taken to the depths where the darkness is home to lava, spiderwebs and vast chasms. Character modelling is equally impressive, in cut scenes you get to see incredibly high detail and the animations are incredibly life like.But this advanced technology comes at a huge cost to the reliability of the gameplay, breaking the immersion. Frequent frame drops and stuttering would plague the game even if I reduce some of the settings. I had to disable frame generation due to system stability, otherwise for the majority of the game I didn’t experience any crashes. The game really does need a little bit more polish before I can say that it deserves to be bought without a second thought, but if the engineering team continue to patch then I am sure this game will be an incredible state in a few months. As it stands the day it is a challenge to get through every level without seeing something interfere with your experience and for me that is incredibly detrimental to the experience of the game.StorylineI won’t pretend I know everything that’s going on in Black Myth Wukong, the story is about the journey to the West, an ancient Chinese story 400 years old. However, I did recognise that the characters were incredibly well thought out in certain the reaction to the community tells me that a huge amount of thought went into the quality of the storytelling.All the characters in the game are very well realised, even the enemies and main NPC’s have incredibly good dialogue and storylines. I genuinely feels like a AAA film, a lot of the scripts are very well articulated and unique - certainly nothing like I’ve seen in similar titles.The story starts in probably the most amazing opening sequence I have ever seen. The scale, the grandeur and the epic nature of this initial battle and how it plays out into the rest of the game I will not forget. That is consistent throughout the game all the way through to the end boss and the closing sequences.GameplayAt its core, black myth Wukong is a action souls-like game. Combat very much revolves around two key concepts, one; managing your stamina so that you can attack and all of the varied combos that go with that, and secondly managing when you’re going to dodge as the game has a very interesting parry system which is more offensive than it is defensive. For me the gameplay in Black myth Wukong is probably some of the best that I’ve experienced in a game. Even though the end bosses took me a number of hours, and a lot of frustration(!), I still found that the game was incredibly just, and I did not find that the game was punishing me unfairly. Moreover, it was genuinely me rushing because I got too excited and thought I would be able to finish that enemy or boss early.Having said that some bosses, and unfortunately the end boss, I do believe are a little bit too scripted and they do not seem as well thought out as perhaps the developer teams thought they would be. The main thing that I have against the end bosses are that you cannot really use the build that you have in order to defeat them. I’m sure there are some incredibly good players out there but for the vast majority of people playing this game they would’ve built up their skill set and want to use their chosen armour and weapon and gameplay to finish the final boss. Unfortunately, the game does not really lean into that idea, moreover encourages you to reset all of your skill points and instead use the armour, weapon and build that would allow you to defeat the boss easily. The problem I have with this is it does not really feel anything other than a scripted way of playing, which I do not like.Upgrading your character is very rewarding as you progress through the game. When you level up your character you get access to new armour and weapons. You can change your play style anytime by resetting your skill points. so if you favour to use spear or if you prefer to use a certain skill set then that is completely up to you, whatever you feel more comfortable with. Throughout the game you find merchant who are you upgrades and access to a store, but I found more over the not that I wouldn’t really interact with them because they didn’t sell the things that I needed and a lot of the key armour and weapons in the game cannot be upgraded at all, which is a shame .MusicThe music in the game is incredibly good, orchestral pieces_the vast epic nature of the game and elevate it to new levels. The quality in the effects and the environment really helped to build immersion, and I have to upload the developers for the use of sound and getting it right in this game.FinalOverall Black miss Wang is an incredibly advanced technical game, I really wish some of the issues that the game experience could’ve been ironed out before release as I found getting through the game a real struggle. Overall worth picking up once those issues are fixed or if you’re playing on console.",Recommended,5389,57.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 26

1633,"A good action game that will quench the thirst of souls-likes/ modern god of war enthusiasts. However, I don't think it's doing anything really revolutionary in terms of gameplay that deserves such a high praise. It seems people are giving it more credit than it deserves in regards to it's unflinching stance on EDI and saying no to the Sweet Baby Inc. influence. I think we need to remember that this is a game made by Chinese developers which are pretty obligated to follow the cultural rules (and restrictions) from their government. So the whole ""f*** you"" to the ""woke"" industry was expected, otherwise I don't see how this would've come out.Pros:- Gorgeous graphics- You don't lose your exp when you die- You can change your build at will- Combat is tight and fluid- Nice if you like ""boss rush"" style of games (107 bosses/mini-bosses)- Lot of content so you're in for a 30 hours+ of gameplay (if you like that kind of thing)Cons:- A lot of people might experience graphical bugs- Enemy hit boxes can be weird sometimes- Trying to drink your health potion if you're pressing another button just don't seem to work- Exploration is much more linear than Elden Ring- Build and combat strategies are much more limited due to lack of weapon variety- Having to re-craft your weapons instead of keeping them. You always keep the unique item required for crafting but need to spend your other materials? This makes no sense.For me it's a good 8/10",Recommended,1196,32.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 26

Any difficult boss? - just respec and try different builds at 0 cost. This game finds a great balance of some casual play and some hard bosses. Graphics are stunning and feels to get lost in the world sometimes.Feedback - there are very few (may be 3-5) annoying bosses in the game whose moves are not good and the boss itself is not fun. They simply made the boss attacks harder by just adding huge delay from swing to hitting the character. Given i came across only 3-5 bosses i think it's okay.

I have tried multiple souls and souls-like games and they just are not for me. Black Myths game play is punishing but doesn't have that distinctive souls game play. So now that I have wasted your time with that, on to the game.Its really fun. You run from boss fight to boss fight each with their own styles. You can level up your abilities but also change them from a save point with absolutely no penalties. Each enemy you fight receives a story in the journal while you fight your way through the chapters. Its story is based on the Journey to the West which has inspired a ton of content over the years.

1690,"After clocking in 55.3 hours and reaching 100% completion, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as my Game of the Year so far. Beginning NG+, I’ve experienced nearly everything the game offers, except for the NG+ achievements. And as of today, I’m still blown away by the experience.First and foremost, the game is just gorgeous. Like, gorgeous AF. The art direction is stunning across the board, with an extraordinary level design that brings Chinese mythology to life with unparalleled beauty. The environments, costumes, and character designs are mythic, imaginative, and meticulously crafted. Every visual detail, from the lighting to the effects, is a spectacle. I’m honestly speechless.The sound design is equally brilliant. The music is minimal, blending perfectly with the ambiance and allowing the world itself to sing. Every enemy, boss, and environment has its own natural soundtrack, filling each area with an immersive atmosphere.The bestiary is possibly the most impressive part of the game. The variety and design of creatures, bosses, and mini-bosses is astonishing. Each character feels unique, with its own elemental theme, moveset, and style. The sheer amount of bosses alone is staggering, and each one is distinct, adding immense depth and challenge to the gameplay.The storyline, while subtle, draws you into Chinese mythology and Wukong's journey of self-discovery and mastery. The plot doesn’t overwhelm you with dramatic love stories or side narratives—it’s all about the relentless thrill of boss battles and surviving the world. For lore lovers, the journals and collectibles add rich context that deepens the experience.Then, there are the side quests. Some of the best content in the game is hidden within these optional missions. Don’t be fooled; “optional” here doesn’t mean lesser quality. Some of the most memorable bosses and fights are tucked away in secret areas. There’s even a hidden ending for those who manage to uncover every secret.Cutscenes are masterfully crafted, and the mini-movies between chapters are works of art in their own right—beautifully animated, full of creativity, and stunningly directed.Gameplay-wise, it’s the perfect blend of God of War and a Souls-like game. From God of War, it borrows the dynamic, combo-heavy combat with tons of abilities, equipment, and varied playstyles, loaded with both visual and gameplay effects. From Souls games, it inherits the toughness, shrines for respawn points, and the enemy respawn mechanic. And like in any good Souls game, there are tons of bosses waiting to test you.Now, for a nearly perfect game, there is one flaw that stands out: the exploration, specifically the invisible walls. At first, it feels like the game limits exploration with these invisible walls, but as you go on, you realize that there’s actually a ton to discover. However, it’s inconsistent. Sometimes you see a gap that looks accessible but isn’t, or you’ll avoid a slope only to realize you can cross it. It creates a disconnect, making the level design feel uncertain. Either open everything for exploration or keep it restricted—this in-between approach leaves players unsure of where they can go.Black Myth: Wukong is practically a 19 or 20/20 for me. This one critique aside, it’s an epic journey through myth, mystery, and combat mastery.",Recommended,2793,55.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 25

1700,"I am at the end of my 1st playthrough and I would like to recommend this game to anyone. I bought the game due to the hype, which of course was due to the release of the demo back in 2020 when there was a lockdown everywhere. The game looks ""open"" and the fight, the graphics was very very impressive from the demo.The game, was slightly disappointing at first as the game was pretty linear. I mean you can't get lost as the open world is not that open. Since I had spent over 3,300 hrs in Sekiro, I cannot help to find some similarity between the two games in terms of ""openness"". Also, some of the tasks or side quests involved back and forth among places. Without following playthrough videos, I am not sure if I can be where I am now in the game. True, I have made the decision to get 100% in my 1st playthrough so I followed playthrough videos. I was going to moan about it until I arrived at the final chapter. It is hugh and there is no hint whatsoever where and what to do next, especially now I can ""fly""!!! I have to give marks to those videos makers for their time to find things out otherwise I almost certainly will be lost and frustrated. Thinking about it, I suppose that this is their design strategy for ""longivity"", if not for the playthrough videos. Saying that, I have also found out that bosses have different moves in new game plus. And of course, one has to play NG+ because of achievements. Like Sekiro, certain resources are restricted, i.e. they cannot be farmed. Oh, just one important information for all interested new players, the Dev. has nerfed the drop rate of some important resources, not only that, they has added a condition that I personally have not come across in other game, which is that the longer if you stay in a location (due to farming), the drop rate which is already low, will drop even lower. I remembered before the last patch, I got so many precious resources without even trying to farm them. Now, I only got 1 out of 10 runs. Don't get me wrong, you can still farm but you will have to be really really patience.Like any other RPG games, one has to upgrade weapons, armours, items, to get stronger, more powerful. There are quite a few weapons but the Dev. has spent a lot of effort balancing them out. So, you gain some but you will lose some. But this is good, As the players will have to think how to build their Wukong. Oh, yeah, just a warning, you cannot change anything during a combat. Everything has to be set up prior to starting a fight. So, you will have to learn the enemies' moves and ability and then set up your Wukong accordingly. I guess that this is the fun and challenging part (on top of the fight).Similar to Sekiro, in order to play this game effectively and smoothly, you really have to do a lot of tinkering with your graphic settings. DO NOT assume that you have, say, a RTX4090, you can just go into the game at the highest settings and play smoothly. There are a lot of complaints blaming the game by people with RTX 40 series GPU. But using simple logic, I reckon that it is a combination of hardware and software. I have a laptop with RTX 3080 and Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU with 16 Gb RAM. So it is not top notch. But I spent about a couple of days researching and then tinkering, I can play the game smoothly, no problem at 74 FPS at 1K and 65 FPS at 2K (using my brother-in-law's 2K monitor at his home).Sorry, I digressed. Without giving away too much, the combat mechanics of the game can be clunky in certain area but mostly smooth. I guess this may be me not getting used to all the different fighting styles as I am more concentrated on getting all the achievements. So, my advice is to spend a lot of time on each fighting style. By the way, unlike the set up, you can change fighting style on the go. So, if you get experienced in all the different styles, the combat can be pretty impressive.Since I am a diehard fan of Sekiro (maybe Ghost of Tsuhima as well, soon), I cannot help to compare the three in terms of combat and the way players can progress in the game. In Sekiro, one is forced to ""gitgud"" in order to progress (as one has to defeat boss to get past and move on). Tsuhima, the progress of players' ability seems to be easier and more organised. And for Black Myth Wukong, hehe, there is XP farming. I mean I was already level 120 something half way through the game. So, I got through some bosses, not by skills but vitality, i.e. get hurt less. In Sekiro, farming XP only get you skills, not strength nor health so you still have to ""gitgud"". Tsuhima, there is not much farming as most enemies don't respawn after killing them. But upgrading skills can be really powerful, especially the stealth ones. Don't get me wrong. You still have to learn the enemies' moves in Black Myth: Wukong so you can learn the timing when to dodge and when to attack. You can't just go barging in. By the way, stealth is not an option in Black Myth: Wukong. You really have to learn to chain your moves in between dodging and healing in Wukong.Now the story, I thought that this game was loosely based on the infamous ""Journey to the West"" but in fact, it is more based on the book called ""Wukong Zhuan"" (loosely translate to biography of Wukong). Journey to the West was translated to English a few decades ago, but there is no English translation for ""Wukong Zhuan"". I only learnt of this a couple of days ago from a Youtube video posted by a Chinese looking lady from Canada. The video was actually about the explanation of the bad endings of this game. So, if you are interested, you can search for it in Youtube. And yes, in my opinion, according to her explanation and conclusions from ""Wukong Zhuan"", it is pretty ""dark"". I guess that is why the game is called ""Black Myth: Wukong"". Apparently, all the hints are actually in the game, from the conversations, mumblings of various NPC. I didn't take notice of most of it so I didn't know or rather what the story is trying to say. From the game, I only have the impression that Game Science have created a game telling how Wukong can be ""alive"" again. There no strong or obvious hints from objects within the game suggesting what was going on. It was all done by the mumblings and conversations in weird high pitch (which is a turn off for me). So, in my opinion, the story of the game is weak but the game itself is very strong and quite entertaining. I mean I will definitely get into NG+, NG++ and so on.",Recommended,5237,371.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 25

1703,"Black Myth: Wukong is a great example of ""video game as an art form"" at its peak.The storytelling, gameplay, visuals, and music are all top-notch. Every aspects are delivered beautifully. Plus each animated little story between chapters is a real treat.Based upon the ""Journey to the west"", the game story is fascinating and even more so with some philosophy from Buddha's teaching.Kinda remind me of the Elden Ring, when the game story is already engaging on its own but really just a glimpse into a much larger world. The best part is drilling into the lore, gain new perspective, and take imagination further beyond.As for the gameplay, I'd say it's like a mix of Bayonetta and Elden Ring.It's quite agile like Bayonetta but stricter input queue by the animations.It's quite difficult like Elden Ring, but more forgiving on the stamina and i-frames dodging.Also, it doesn't drag-on like God of War, which often prolongs playtime by lots of trivial puzzles, sidetracks and mobs arena.WuKong is a boss-rush with so much variety in boss design. There are humanoid bosses, bear, rat, spiders, bugs, rock, loong, two giant heads flying and rolling, etc...Every boss has its unique style and moveset, but none come off as completely out of place, because the player character is just as fast and agile, and has lots of moveset and spells at your disposal.I think it has a nice balance of diffculty, it's challenging at times but still very much doable for the average gamer to experience the whole game. (or as a parent with little game time)Overall, a truly well crafted single-player experience.",Recommended,1329,67.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 25

Healing can be a bit unresponsive as it does not delay the input if you get knocked down and try to take a quick swig while getting back up but once you get past that it's a really amazing game. Great story and a world inspired by Chinese mythology and The Journey to the West. I really liked the perfect dodge system and the ability to change my build at any resting point to really let me try everything out. I fought every boss, meditated in every location, and met all the characters for the journal and I enjoyed the entire experience. Baije was amazing and really added a lot to the Destined One's journey; I think his last few lines of dialogue in the game was my favorite part. It is not as challenging as FROM software titles but to me it played a lot like Elden Ring with its own unique style and I had a lot of fun with it.

1748,"Black Myth: Wukong is not as good as you think. Although, still an amazing game.Now, before you throw rotten food (or clown rewards) at me, allow me to elaborate.This game is surely a breath of fresh air in the stale as hell AAA development in recent years, and I still recommend it to most players that even remotely like souls-likes and hack-and-slash games.However, I must point out several of my main gripes with this game.The story in this game is kind of poorly written, as it is VERY hard to follow what's actually going on and what do you need to do. Especially if you didn't read the Journey to the West (which this game is basically a sequel for). Absolute majority of characters speak in poetic nonsense and I've caught myself more than a couple of dozen times in the middle of another monologue (because, you know, our main character is mute) thinking: ""What in the f*** is he/she talking about and what is the point of this?"". That's probably why I liked the hog general the most in this game. He speaks plain, no bullsh*t, no poetry, no riddles. Always right to the point.To be honest, I see this game as a glorified boss rush game, considering the ridiculous number of bosses in it. Most of them are fine, moderately challenging and fun to fight against, but towards the later part of the game more and more bosses start to introduce absolutely bullsh*t mechanics into the fights that make fighting against them absolutely insufferable. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a newbie to Souls-like games, I haven't actually played the original Souls trilogy, because I absolutely despised the controls, but I have finished Sekiro a couple of times, several playthroughs of Elden Ring, finished both recent Star Wars soulslikes and there's two or three games not really worth mentioning.But if I've learned anything in any of those games, there is almost always one rule they all follow. DON'T SCREW WITH BASE COMBAT MECHANICS. Like dodging. And ooooh-ho-ho-boy, they did in this game. I'll just point out one of them, the posessed hog general boss fight, where you fight in mud and are forced to slow roll because of it. This fight was probably the worst one in the game. There are many more fights that do similar things and I absolutely despised them. Not even mentioning the final fight which took me more tries than the final fight with the four-phase boss in Sekiro, not even kidding. All because he had so much bullsh*t in his moveset. Also, fights towards the end become a bit stale because of my next point.You only have one weapon in this game: The staff. And by itself it would be fine, Sekiro does basically the same thing, with unlocking new techniques and stuff. And you only have a single light attack combo, which again, is fine per se and the same happens in Sekiro, but there is a major, MAJOR distinction here. Sekiro has a parry that is available at ANY time, for ANY strike that is not an unblockable move. Here, however, you only have dodge. And a parry if you chose to use it on a sizeable cooldown. When it's down, all you can do defensively is dodge. What I mean is, the defense is NOT a part of your offense, like in Sekiro. The bossfights are not a rhythmical intricate dance, instead it's a light attack spam with an occasional parry until you get enough energy to do a heavy attack. It gets really, REALLY boring towards the endgame, and the final boss just DODGES most of the heavy attacks after letting you land ONE. After that - nothing but light attacks or transformation... light attacks.So yeah, in the end combat itself got really bland. Spam light attacks, dodge, wait for opening - do a heavy attack. Rince, repeat.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong was a great, fun experience for me, but only for a single playthrough, because the story or setting weren't coherent enough to make me want to find more of it, the combat mechanics got really repetitive (and again, making me actively avoid new encounters), and after defeating many of the game's bosses I've said to myself ""I never ever want to fight this thing ever again"" because of very frustrating mechanics they had. So I don't think I'll want to do another playthrough or a new game+. It's a one-off for me.Still, great graphics, good music, amazing animations, appealing characters, and most importantly, no real-life agenda squeezed in.",Recommended,3573,46.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 25

1795,"Firstly, I must say that I have actually stopped playing games for several years now. When this game came out, I was mesmerised by the incredible graphics and the storyline. It's based on one of the 4 great Chinese classic that I grew up reading and watching on TV. I know I must get this game and went to buy a gaming laptop just for this game.The story is impressive. The graphics are remarkable. It feels like watching a movie. I'm not really a melee type of game player and I struggled much with the combat initially. There are different combination of armour and weapons along with various items, brews, spells and spirits to help you decide how you want to fight each boss. I improved as I played on and learnt so much more, and totally enjoying every boss fight. It's such an exhilarating feeling to beat a boss each time. This is one game that I have played the longest - 130+ hours and counting. I have now started NG+ and will complete at least this cycle before waiting for the DLC.I don't know about other similar type of games, but based on what this game offers, I heartily recommend it to everyone!",Recommended,909,195.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 24

I have now finished this game and have taken on Sekiro, which is a lot harder, but makes me glad I played Wukong first.This game is unforgiving in all of the right ways, but just remember, overcoming the challenge will feel amazing.If you love Chinese Mythology, and love weilding a staff and beating up bad guys, this is the one for you!",Recommended,731,197.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 24

You have to run past the same 10 normal enemies every time to get back to the boss that just totally wrecked you. Just to get wrecked again.Definitely not a game for casual gamers. This is for hardcore gamers that enjoy getting punished by Dark Souls and other soulslike games. This is why I can not recommend this game because it might be too hard for most normal people that want to enjoy a video game. For most people there is no enjoyment in getting constantly punished by a game.2) Level design:The level design is ultra linear. You can't even go exploring the levels because they are all surrounded by invisible barriers that block you. I would have hoped to have just a little bit more freedom to explore those beautiful sceneries.Pros:1) Graphics:The graphics and levels are incredibly beautiful. I think I have never seen a game with such epic looking levels. The attention to detail is also absolutely crazy. I have never seen that in any other game.2) Story and lore: The story and lore are pretty nice and I enjoy them a lot.3) Free resetting of skills, attributes and spells: The game lets you reset ALL ""sparks"" (experience points for leveling up) at any save point during the game.

For me, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just a game—it’s a masterpiece that grabs you from the first moment and keeps you hooked until the very end. If you're looking for the best game of 2024 - this is it.The gameplay is perfectly balanced - the combat requires attention and skill, and every battle feels unique. Side quests and puzzles are impressively varied and deeply integrated into the game world, adding even more charm to this story. The well-known tale of the Monkey King is presented here with such care and attention to detail that you truly feel part of this legendary world.I especially want to highlight the game’s historical accuracy and the detailed character design. Every enemy, ally, and even random NPC feels like they stepped right out of the pages of Chinese mythology. The clothing, armor, weapons, and movements are so meticulously crafted that every battle feels like part of an epic saga. This depth of detail immerses you in ancient China and makes you appreciate the legends upon which the game is built.Every aspect of the game, from enemy design to the layout of the locations, radiates love for the original story. The graphics and animations are breathtaking, and the game’s atmosphere transports you to an actual epic. And let’s be honest - who doesn’t love the Monkey King?Black Myth: Wukong is a game you simply cannot miss. It has set a new standard for action RPGs and mythological adaptations.

1890,"这大概是我第一次如此认真地评价一款游戏。作为中国人，孙悟空的故事陪伴了我的整个童年。小时候，我无数次挥舞起棍棒，想象自己就是孙悟空。现在，除了小说、电视剧、动画片，又有了一款优秀的游戏，可以体验齐天大圣的战斗。我从2020年的预告片就关注了这款游戏，当时除了激动，更多的是怀疑游戏成品能否达到宣传的水平。现在，我可以自豪地说，《黑神话：悟空》已经超出了我的一切想象。实事求是地说，这游戏比我想象中难，又没有难度选项。如果有人告诉我这是个魂游，我可能就不预购了（游戏科学一直说他们的游戏是ARPG，但是很多玩家觉得是魂游）。可那是孙悟空啊，相信但凡看过《西游记》小说，或者看过改编的电视剧或者动画片，都能明白这三个字的分量有多重。如今我花了97个小时，完成了所有成就，马上要封档，我真诚地推荐大家体验一下这款游戏。也许您是外国人，没有看过《西游记》小说也没有看过相关的影视作品。但是，这是个发售仅仅2个月就全成就率超过10%的游戏，不想试试看吗？This is probably the first time I've taken the time to write such a serious review for a video game. As a Chinese person, the story of the Monkey King has been a constant companion throughout my childhood. When I was a boy, I often swung sticks around, imagining myself as Sun Wukong. Now, besides the novel, TV series, the animated shows, there is an excellent game that let you experience the thrill of fighting under the flag of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.I’ve been following this game since its trailer was released in 2020. Along with my excitement, I had doubts about whether the final product would live up to the hype. But now, I can proudly say that, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" has exceeded all my expectations.To be honest, this game is harder than I expected - and there are no difficulty settings. If someone had told me it was a Souls-like game, I might not have pre-ordered it (GameScience labels it as an ARPG, but many players consider it a Souls-like). But it’s about Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven! Anyone who has read the ""Journey to the West"" novel or watched the TV series or animations would understand what does it mean!I’ve spent 97 hours completing all the achievements and am about to shelve the game. I sincerely recommend give it a try. Even if you are unfamiliar with ""Journey to the West"" , this game, that within just two months of its release, has an all-achievement completion rate of over 10%. Isn’t that worth checking out?Это, вероятно, первый раз, когда я решил написать столь серьёзный отзыв о видеоигре. Как человек китайского происхождения, история Царя Обезьян сопровождала меня на протяжении всего детства. Будучи ребёнком, я часто размахивал палками, представляя себя Сунь Укуном. Теперь, помимо романа, телесериала и анимационных шоу, появилась отличная игра, которая позволяет испытать восторг от сражений в роли Великого Мудреца, равного Небесам.Я следил за этой игрой с момента выхода её трейлера в 2020 году. Вместе с волнением у меня были сомнения, сможет ли конечный продукт оправдать ожидания. Но сейчас я с гордостью могу сказать, что ""Black Myth: Wukong"" превзошла все мои ожидания.Честно говоря, эта игра сложнее, чем я ожидал, - и в ней нет настройки уровня сложности. Если бы кто-то сказал мне, что это игра в стиле Souls, возможно, я бы не стал её предзаказывать (Game Science называет эту игру ARPG, но многие игроки считают её игрой в стиле Souls). Но ведь это игра о Сунь Укуне, Великом Мудреце, равном Небесам! Любой, кто читал роман ""Путешествие на Запад"" или смотрел телесериалы и анимационные шоу, поймёт значение этих слов!Я провёл 97 часов, выполняя все достижения, и готов отложить игру. Искренне рекомендую попробовать её. Даже если вы не знакомы с ""Путешествием на Запад"", эта игра, за два месяца после выхода, имеет более 10% игроков, выполнивших все достижения.

1900,"Black Myth: Wukong is definitely a visually impressive game. The scenery and details are excellent, creating an immersive atmosphere that draws you in. However, the gameplay, especially the exploration, comes with some pretty frustrating issues.The exploration is a bit of a mess. There are invisible walls everywhere, severely limiting your ability to explore freely. You never know where you can actually go: where it looks like you can jump or move, you hit an invisible wall, and where you’d assume you can’t go, suddenly you find out you can. On top of that, sometimes these walls just disappear, and you fall to your death unexpectedly.Combat is generally fun, but there are some annoying aspects. For example, during boss fights, when a cutscene triggers, some of your spells get canceled, wasting mana in the process. This can break the flow of the battle and leave you feeling a bit frustrated.Overall, despite these irritations, it was enjoyable to play. The game is not too difficult, and while some parts were frustrating, it wasn't too overwhelming. I’d recommend Black Myth: Wukong, but just be prepared for some exploration headaches.Recommended, but with caution.",Recommended,991,55.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 23

Very well designed fighting mechanics, boss fights are well adjusted so the player does not feel the need to get extra strong for a certain encounter. Also the ''talent tree and stats'' are quite unique and refreshing which really boosts the game even more. Not only the story is amazing it shows a lot of care and patience in how it was told throughout the game (assuming it will be similar later on). 6 hours in and just finished chapter 1, I gotta say if the other 5 chapters are of similar quality, personally game of the year 2024 should go to Black Myth: Wukong!!

Admiring the hard word the Game Science team has put on this.

Ch3 final boss was cool. Then ch4 when we met spider waifu, overall very good but the boss fight that slow you down cuz you are fighting in mud is annoying and the domain expansion from final boss is also annoying( i didn't have the needle) but still peak ch , story at the end made me cry ,don't know why. Ch 4 is also peak ch but very short. Ch5 is also very good but i like 4 and 5 more. Need some time to get use to combat but it's really fun. Normal bosses are not that hard but secret bosses are hard and very coolwhy this is not 10some bosses have a lot of hp, maybe im under lvthere is an armor set that need to play two times to get full set (i gonna play it again but it's kinda dumb to have 2 piece at first and another 2 pieces in another run)some bosses are annoying to fight but very few",Recommended,845,53.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 23

Turns out this runs good enough (40-50fps) with most settings on medium and some on low. Im definitily gonna replay this when i get a better computer tho. Visuals were already great, but having everything at higher setting probably elevate the experience to a whole new level. Im not really a souls like player so i was worried i would just quit because its too hard (i did that on sekiro because the parry mechanics are pretty unforgiving for beginners), but i could really feel myself becoming better with every enemy i deafeated. Even tho there are some hard enemys, once you learn their patterns its just a matter of good timing.

1956,"Black Myth: Wukong is something special. It is gorgeous mix of action, exploration, and storytelling that completely pulled me in. What stood out to me the most were the boss battles. There are so many of them, and each one feels different and challenging in its own way. The variety of enemies is insane too. Just imagine: every creature has its own touching backstory in the game's bestiary!You can definitely tell the developers were inspired by games like Dark Souls with the intense, thoughtful combat, and God of War for the sheer scale and epic feel of the action. But at the same time, Black Myth: Wukong feels totally fresh and unique because of its Chinese mythology and visual style. That blend of familiar and new kept me hooked the whole way through.The only thing that felt far from perfect to me was the presence of incredibly large, empty areas in the third part of the game. They invite exploration, but there’s no reward for doing so, which is really disappointing for a detail-oriented player like me.Last - but not the least - are six cartoons between each part of the game. Wow. They’re stunning - like mini-movies that not only look amazing but add so much to the story. Each one felt like a reward after a tough section, pulling me even deeper into Sun Wukong’s world.

You can vary your style or change your build as you see fit as many times as you like provided you have the items in your inventory.There's a huge number of bosses and many of them have fleshed out entrance scenes and second phases. The story of the game told various interaction with bosses, companions and end of chapter animated stories keeps you engaged and invested throughout. There are many secret areas and encounters. Even with exploring everything you will surely miss some and have to come back later. Which adds to the amazement of this game.To say i'd rate this 10/10 doesn't do it justice.

Along with the previously mentioned, it is jam-packed with content and has amazing scenery with some decent gameplay to boot. I also have to praise this game for being so generous with skill point respecs. Definitely worth its asking price!However, it does commit some game design no-no's (imo) and may be slightly overrated by some. Some of the flaws include: Areas with scarce shrines (bonfires), some shrines far away from bosses (long boss runbacks), heavily delayed inputs after some animations, the occasional camera issue, and being overly explorative without any real exploration guide mechanic.Good game!8/10",Recommended,612,46.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 23

The story is epic with rich Chinese mythology. Diverse gameplay: different stances, upgrades, spells, transformations, items, etc. It's a lot of fun to fight bosses. You want more and more. That's why I couldn't stop until I unlocked everything, completed all the quests, and defeated all the secret bosses.Cons: sometimes you get lost in some chapters due to the lack of intuitiveness in where to go and what to do. Also, despite the plot being interesting, the delivery is often weak. I don't know if this is due to the translation or the fact that the Chinese devs do not know how to reveal the essence of the story, or maybe they make the players guess for themselves on purpose.8.5/10",Recommended,706,60.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 23

This is a historical game for China and chinese developers, it seems in talent we are getting exposed to barely scratching the surface. Eventually this developer and others will make China streamlined to vast audiences and hope it helps its government see that games are a profitable margin that can bring many jobs to the country.

2008,"What a game! Initially I was worried about the difficulty but if you stick with it you can get it. I don't like souls like games, they've just never gelled with me so it made me hesitant.This game is something else entirely. It's a beautiful ode to Chinese Mythology, something refreshing and new in our already tried and true fantasy worlds.It's graphically beautiful but you will need a chunky card to get the most out of it. My 4070 super cannot quite get to the heights of the more powerful cards but it does look great.Gameplay is simple to grasp but difficult to master, there are a number of playstyles on offer and I'm sure there are many viable builds. It can be a bit hard to understand what the descriptions mean but if you try enough you'll get it. The attacks are smooth and precise, with the character reactions making you feel in control and powerful.Exporation is both risk & reward in the begining when you are not that good at the game. You have a sense of fear and rightly so because some monsters are gonna hurt you real bad.There is frustration I won't lie, you will feel a sense of unfairness in places, especially chapter 3 where you can get knocked off a ledge or edge of a cliff.But the boss fights well, it's all up to you and your current skill level. You will need to learn the bosses patterns and what works for you. Eventually you will get better at this. By the final chapters you will be dodging attacks you have never seen before and beating bosses the first time you face them.There will be times where you think to yourself, how the hell am I gonna do this and you will get angry. My advice... put the controller down. Take a break and come back.The sense of achievement for finally beating that boss is worth it and Wukong rewards you for taking the hard path. Everyone will want to get the real ending, the pay off for the final secret boss is an EPIC sequence which will have you chanting, ""Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!"" in a deep voice.This is a game that is worth taking a risk on and even though the journey has been tough for me it was one that was worth every minute. I'm a father of 2 young boys, I don't have as much time as I used to so it took me some time to finish (2 months).What a game! I 100% recommend.

2020,"For me, two things make me fall in love with a game: a great story and fun gameplay that lets me escape reality. Black Myth: Wukong excels in both. Based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the story is incredibly engaging, with stunning animations and well-designed characters that pull you deeper into the narrative.Created in Unreal Engine, the visuals are breathtaking, with crisp textures and detailed environments. Every frame feels like a scene from a mythological world. The cutscenes are especially impressive, like watching anime-style fights with realistic graphics.The world is gorgeous, but it's not open-world. Instead, it’s more linear, with invisible walls that sometimes break immersion. While I understand blocking access with cliffs or rocks, running into invisible barriers is frustrating. I wish the game allowed more freedom to explore.Level design is good overall, though I missed some side quests due to how levels are designed. It’s a small issue, but for players who like to catch everything in one go, it can be annoying.The gameplay is where the game truly shines. Though it borrows elements from Souls-like games, it feels more like a mix of Jedi: Fallen Order, Nioh, and God of War. The combat is smooth, fun, and evolves with new mechanics introduced throughout the game. The progression system is rewarding, letting you feel your character’s growth. The game offers a variety of spells, abilities, and nearly 80 bosses, many of which provide tough, satisfying challenges.The skill tree is balanced and well-designed, making every skill useful. Unlike other games where most skills feel pointless, here every upgrade matters. To unlock all skills, you need to reach level 342, which keeps the gameplay exciting and rewards mastery of combat.However, the game has performance issues. On my RTX 4060, certain areas and cutscenes caused frame drops. Console players have reported similar problems. Despite these technical flaws, the game is still an amazing experience.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredibly fun and well-crafted game with an engaging story, smooth gameplay, and breathtaking visuals. I give it a 9.8/10, losing a bit for not being open-world and for some performance issues.

2042,"Story and visuals are fantastic, pretty everything else was really disappointing and ran poorly.tldr: 3/5 get it on sale.Combat feels meh... even after making an effort to get used to it. The game encourages you to use strong attacks, but implemented them in an unusual way that isn't explained super well in my opinion. Feels like it took inspiration from fighting games that focus on complicated combos which amounted to some interesting ideas that that weren't implemented well. Once you finally figure out how heavy atk is meant to work, its still annoying to use properly and constantly whiffs. I had a similar experience with all other special moves unlocked in the skill tree and ended up constantly respeccing everything back into just health and stamina. I gave up and just used light attack at all times, which made combat far less frustrating, but very tedious.A cut-scene in an early level pretty much directly tell you that you should explore and look for resources or carefully plan how you approach encounters. Exploration is also disappointing. Constantly running into invisible walls quickly kills any motivation to explore. Collecting resources on the ground is really annoying as you have to carefully stop in exactly the right spot to get the prompt to collect and its nearly impossible to do on the move. Combine that with crafting and consumables feeling pretty irrelevant, killed my motivation to search for resources. As a result, I completely stopped looking around to appreciate all the beautiful scenery they put everywhere.A (partially) unskippable cut-scene in the middle of a boss fight that most people will probably have to retry at a least a few times is admittedly a pretty minor issue, but still super annoying and unnecessary. This was the last straw for me and I kinda just checked out for the remainder of my short playtime.Really don't understand the hype with this game. Seems like it was marketed as a souls-like, but missed the mark on several key aspects of what makes a good souls-like and tried to make up for it with fancy visuals.Its ok, but not worth full price.",Not Recommended,1757,7.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 22

One common complaint is that its a glorified button masher with no depth, and while the combat could benefit from added moves, its far from boring or repetitive. The main issues I have with the game is the silent protagonist, lack of a map and an invisible wall problem. Though these issues exist, the rest of the game far outweighs the negative presented and I highly recommend playingImportant to note that you absolutely need a strong computer to run this, I could get by on a 1650 but I do not recommend that",Recommended,543,136.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 22

2100,"Black Myth: Wukong What a game!Very anticipated for this one and it delivered! Won't write much or not spoil anything except for it was a really good game.Graphics was amazing and beautiful, sound was amazing and satisfying.Combat was so fluent and the dodge is probably one of the satisfying dodge mechanics I've ever encountered so far. Some minor things about combat was my moves did not always connect with some bosses due to hitboxes, maybe they will fixc that for later?Some annoying mid combat cancellation on spells I was trying to do and wait for it to go off cooldown but that's also some minor stuff that was annoying at some parts, for example a tough boss fight.Game feels like a linear adventure game that I truly love, don't care about invis walls and all that. Exploration was really fun and hearken me back to God of War type of style , explore get new stuff for your journey and currency all the good stuff.I really recommend this game, beautiful culture and amazing artwork on the characters in the game. I recommend this!",Recommended,859,81.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 21
2101,"What a game!Combat feels fluid and rewarding, offering a unique experience compared to FromSoft games. The combat here is more rhythmic, so once you get a feel for the boss' attack patterns, perfect dodging becomes much easier. The three stances each have their purpose, and my personal favorite is Smash and Thrust, as both incorporate their own parry mechanics. Parrying is a step above perfect dodging, and once you pull it off, the satisfaction in combat increases tenfold.Now let's talk about the story and its presentation. To be honest, I only had a surface-level understanding of Journey to the West before playing, but after watching the Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 animations, I was inspired to read the entire story. Knowing the Journey to the West backstory really enhances your appreciation of the narrative in Black Myth: Wukong. Game Science did a few things that stand out, like the animations at the end of each chapter, the giant mural-like posters that appear, and how they tie in multiple New Game+ iterations with the story itself.It's my GOTY for 2024, much like Baldur's Gate 3 was for 2023. Gaming is only getting better from here. If you're tired of how Battle Passes and Live Service games are treating you, vote with your wallet.

2139,"This was hard for me to say no about recommending this game. It is a masterpiece in a lot of ways, beautiful, epic cut-scenes and fight scenes, cool enemy and character design, great story. It has everything you could want in a game. The problem is, that in its current state at the time of me writing this review, there is some sort of input bug that causes your buttons to get stuck within your quick menu on controller. For example, you would hold R2 to bring up your quick menu on a PS controller, but as soon as that menu was opening, there would be a button, sometimes even multiple buttons that will be stuck within that menu and automatically press, making you either use the wrong ability, use an ability at an inopportune time, or rendered completely unable to use any abilities or items at all. It was a nuisance that I dealt with for a good portion of the game because I liked the game so much, but ultimately ended up eventually giving up due to the necessity of being able to use items and abilities in some of the later harder battles. If i really buckled down I could probably continue and beat these bosses, but at this point it has just become more frustrating than it is worth and adding literally hours onto fights that would probably be able to be whipped out in 4-5 tries if the abilities would work as intended. I will wait to hear if there is a patch or something that fixes this issue, but until then, a bit upset at paying premium price for a game that has a game breaking bug.",Not Recommended,1221,65.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

2150,"133 hours, level 153 to beat the game. I am not a great fan of action games as such; I am attracted by the story, lore and beauty of which this particular game has PLENTY. The character and Yaoguai stories that you can read after meeting/defeating mobs are amazing. Also, for me Wukong was a flashback from my childhood, for I read ""Journey to the West"" when I was a boy, liked it much, and recognized many characters (although I find the authors' interpretation of Zhu Bajie dull, and miss the comical element of his character that was very much present in the novel).Visuals/soundtrack are a solid 10/10. The game is meant to be played with a gamepad, and would be extremely difficult to play otherwise, but the controls are quite convenient and easy to learn. There are no blocks; dodging is your main defensive mechanic, and ""dodging perfectly"" is important, but luckily not essential to beat the game (""dodge perfectly"" advice is also a useful criterion by which you would know that another Youtube adviser does or doesn't distinguish between ""skill"" and ""strategy""). There are combos, and they look very cool, but most of them are automatically activated when you press one button several times or alternate between two buttons.For the likes of me that have family, children, poor eyesight and less-than-perfect reflexes. Luckily for us, the closest analogy to Wukong is not Dark Souls, but rather God of War, except for boss fights. Certain parts of Wukong are overcrowded with bosses, and while optional boss fights can be quite fun, a regular, mandatory boss fight in Wukong is comparable to fighting a Valkyrie in God of War on above average difficulty setting (first you suffer without understanding what is going on; after a dozen attempts you learn to survive for long enough to actually figure out what happens, after two dozen attempts you learn how to survive and fight back, then after watching Youtube advice or figuring it out on your own or getting especially lucky you beat him). Challenging? Yes. Rewarding? I'd say, around 50 attempts at each mandatory boss rather spoils than spices up the game. If I were to give advice, I'd say regular mobs don't need tweaking but bosses do: introduce difficulty levels as multipliers for character/boss damage: current game settings, IMHO, would be OK as ""hard"", -15% boss damage/+ 15% your damage as ""medium"", ""-30%/+30%"" easy, ""-50%/+50%"" would have been ""story mode"".A feature of Wukong that I find very appealing is variability: unlike traditional action RPGs, you can more-or-less costlessly change the parameters of your character at any time in the game, tailoring your monkey for the specific fight he is about to face. To my opinion, the developers did a good job of balancing the character development tree: most parts of the game can be successfully managed using different builds, which encourages the player to experiment and try new things.All in all, I don't regret paying for this game. And yes - once for the whole game I activated a trainer with -50% to enemy damage. This was the last boss fight (""empty shell"") and by that time I have beaten every other boss in the game without cheating, so after my regular ~50 attempts with the final guy decided that I don't want to spend that much time overcoming a barrier that will not teach me anything useful for subsequent game, for he's really the last one.",Recommended,2807,140.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

Some bosses are challenging for sure, but the game overall is not overly punishing. Respecs are cost-free, thus players are free to experiment with different builds and talents. While I feel that the excellent lore could have been delivered differently, it is mostly a personal preference.Highly recommended!PROS:+ Absolute Cinema+ Great gameplay, with a huge variety of bosses+ Great music, environment/asthetics sand atmosphere+ Great graphics and animations+ Story is interesting and the references with actual JTTW are very nice+ Well written interesting characters with great interactions for certain items+ Secret areas and bosses are insanely funCONS (seriously most of them are just minor things):- Even though the lore and story very good, they are hard to follow and digest without any context or study, and the different order to scenes during cutscenes make it ever harder.- Invisible walls sometimes are annoying. Its not that clear where they will be present since their placement is not that consistent.- Experienced some performance issues in some very specific moments of the game. In general the game is relatively hard to run, therefore it might be explained to to that fact.- Personally, I didn't mind at all that most of the non-boss enemies were not hard at all, since the game offers almost 15-20 bosses per chapter. But some people might look for that extra challenge.",Recommended,1306,70.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

2179,"Black Myth: Wukong is an eye-catcher, no doubt about it. The game looks absolutely incredible, and it’s clear the combat system took a lot of inspiration from the God of War series—especially with those heavy, impactful attacks and fluid cutscene transitions. If you like that style, you’ll probably get hooked by the boss fights alone. They’re challenging, engaging, and definitely the highlight of the game.What I liked:Epic Boss Fights: The game is basically one epic boss fight after another, and honestly, that’s where it shines. Each boss feels unique and requires you to adapt, and the difficulty keeps things interesting. If you enjoy tough but rewarding combat, this is for you.Cutscenes & Visuals: Seriously, the cutscenes are top-tier. It’s like watching a movie. There’s so much detail and care put into the way the story is told, and it keeps you immersed in the world.Upgrades & Skill Tree: The progression system is pretty solid. There’s enough flexibility in the skill tree to let you experiment with different playstyles, and upgrading your gear feels satisfying without becoming a grindfest.Not Much Between Boss Fights: As fun as the boss fights are, there’s not a lot to do in between. You’ll find yourself moving from one big encounter to the next without much else going on. The game feels kind of empty outside of combat, which is a shame considering how cool the world looks.No Map, No Clear Direction: This was my biggest gripe. The game doesn’t give you a map, and there’s very little guidance on where to go. It’s linear, but there are plenty of secrets and hidden paths, so it’s super frustrating when you’re stuck wandering around aimlessly. For a game that has some really cool level design, not having a map or more direction just makes it more of a headache.All in all, Black Myth: Wukong is worth playing if you’re into games like God of War, where the focus is on intense, skill-based combat. The boss fights are killer, and the visuals are breathtaking. But outside of those core elements, it’s a bit bare. Lack of direction can be frustrating, and the space between bosses could’ve been more fleshed out. Still, if you’re here for the fights, it’ll deliver.",Recommended,1823,63.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

This is a game that genuinely values the source material, you can just tell that it was made with love, delicately. In terms of boss design there were certain issues such as frame-drops, lingering hitboxes, and certain bosses being extremely spammy however they can always be refurbished and fixed so I am not going to capitalise on those as it would be injudicious. The bosses in this game were exceptionally designed, I always looked forward to the next boss in every chapter, never skipped a cutscene and thoroughly enjoyed everything the game had to offer including side quests, secret zones and bosses..etc. This is a game befitting a GOTY title and no one can convince me otherwise.",Recommended,712,60.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

For those who are used to playing these types of games this is obviously easier but for the standard player this is simply not a fun game as the constant dying with no progression is demoralising.For those with more time to waste good luck and give it some stick, for me this game is relegated to the ""Not Played group""For those wondering if they should get this game, it's a great game, fantastic visuals, but if you are limited by time or not used to this type of game-play I would seriously keep in mind the 2hr refund period when you first start playing, st least you can refund if you dont like it.",Not Recommended,784,7.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

2187,"Yellow Wind Sage, completely broken mechanics combine for a truly frustrating experience.I dodge and the game doesn't give me the dodge, I use immobilize and if he's in his sand form it doesn't work yet I'm charged for the ability. I use a pluck of many and if I'm hit while using it I'm charged for the ability yet I have no duplicates. If I accumulate 3 power points and use Pillar Stance to heal up I can still be hit while on the top of Pillar Stance and am charged all 3 points for it without the heal, what's funner is that when I'm at the top of Pillar Stance and press the heal button (LB on controller) Monkey just ignores the input and so I wind up having to spam LB to heal at the top of Pillar Stance. If I dodge Yellow Wind Sage's hail mary football punt kick that literally takes half of my health away, the game says I didn't dodge and I'm either kicked or track kicked anyway. See the problem with this game, unlike Sekiro where if you time a block imperfectly you can still block, this game, if you don't time the dodge perfectly you're punished for it big time, and then unlike Sekiro where the block animation is way faster you're asked to account for an animation delay with Monkey, you're asked to factor this into an incredibly small dodge window (feels like, and I'm not exaggerating, a 10ms perfect dodge window) and it's just beyond aggravating, oh and for whatever reason, the environment can hinder your attacks, for example, I had 3 points built up and did a Smash Stance attack but there was some sand in between me and Yellow Wind Sage and wouldn't you know it, whoops, the game decided to charge me all 3 points for the attack that was hindered by this and well, Yellow Wind Sage can fly all around the screen, all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ attacks and you're asked with a straight face to dodge them and when you do you're still penalized and hit anyway. To add insult to injury, after you're killed, repeatedly, by this broken boss (and every broken boss before it, don't even get me started on Tiger Vanguard) you then have to wait out a, and I'm not exaggerating, 30 second animation sequence where Yellow Wind Sage dispenses some wisdom over your dead body, something about mercy, and it's always the same line, the same 30 second sequence, followed by another 30 second loading screen (this with a 7800x3D and a Samsung 990 Pro M.2 nVME with 6GB/s read and write) and then another 10 second hair falling animation sequence at the last respawn point and then you're asked to run back to the enemy for at least another 60-90 seconds, so every time you die it's waiting around with your thumb up your a$$ for 2-3 minutes. And I don't understand the 30 second load time because the area in question (the Cellar) has no NPC's, no assets whatsoever, nothing needs to be reset, and all of the textures look like Playstation 2 quality even on Cinematic (another gripe I have with this game).Like it's just baked in, the developers want to make the experience as punishing as possible and waste as much of your time as possible. Then I'm right back at the fight and I know what attacks are coming, I know what must be done to counter them, but the game only gives me a dodge maybe 65% of the time and a perfect dodge maybe 10% of the time. I'm not incompetent, I'm not a bad gamer, I don't have bad reflexes, there is simply something fundamentally wrong with the dodge mechanic, it's window and how it's connected to an animation delay that the player is asked to account for. So it's 2-3 minutes of fighting and invariably dying because of broken mechanics and then another 2-3 minutes of loading screens and animation sequences and running the same barren path back to the boss and after about an hour of this I'm ready to punch my monitor.Like this is absolutely not fun in any way shape or form, and after I beat this boss, I will be asked to do it again in 30 minutes with another equally frustrating boss. That's been this game up until now, no real exploration, no real mentally challenging navigation or interesting fights along the way, it's one frustrating boss punctuated by a slog of uninteresting enemies who all similarly do cheesy crap along the way with the same broken dodge system after another broken boss.This game has NOTHING on Sekiro, absolutely nothing, I understand the praise it received during a time when every other game is peddling woke propaganda, and I appreciate that, I just don't think the actual mechanics are very good nor the combat very fun. Hell it doesn't even run very good. I have Dying Light 2 which also has Ray Tracing and I can run that game on Balanced DLSS with Frame Gen @ 75 FPS basically everywhere with an RTX 4090 @ dual 4K. This game I had to go with HUB Medium RT Performance recommended settings and with DLSS on Performance (doesn't matter actually, because the texture quality is so bad they look that much more out of place with higher DLSS) I'm at 70 FPS most of the time but this is basically on Medium RT with DLSS on performance and it doesn't hold a candle to Dying Light 2 yet seems to cost 50% more performance. So it runs like crap, feels like crap, combat sucks, lore sucks, story is meh, I don't know man, I think this game has a lot of undue praise. Add in the bad boss design and eventually after about an hour of bull$hit I'm here writing about my thoughts of this game.Oh and I got the stupid item from the stupid bore that shuts down Yellow Wind Sage's wind mode, my issue is, how is the player supposed to figure all of this out without a youtube tutorial? Like seriously, how many of you got all of these items the boar wanted and found him constantly moving around all over the map an satisfied all the requirements of this side-quest without first hearing about it on a forum or similarly complaining about how difficult Yellow Wind Sage is and being told to go an get this item / ability?",Not Recommended,4805,52.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 21

They indeed really put a lot of effort into storytelling, but how they tell the story is confusing to me.- The beautiful graphic and environment design cannot be an excuse for neglecting those two above. I personally find Sekiro has more 'life' in the environment and art direction- RPG elements is built in the impression of 'Action RPG'.

I prefer playing without tutorials, so it was annoying to learn that I would miss some stuff if I wasn't careful.

2248,"Not a soulslike, more like a character action RPG akin to God of War. The mechanics favour dodges and perfect dodges. It's the kind of game where you could beat it as a Lvl 1 Wretch with a stick, so you can take heart that if there's a problem you just need to improve your skills to overcome it.Build variety is affected by skills chosen and armor sets, and there is no one ""best build"" as your playstyle will massively determine the spells chosen and armor used. Although imo pillar stance having no parry option just makes it worse than the others (plenty of other players have shown this to be false, it's just my wrong opinion)Graphics are phenomenal with minimal drops in framerate for me (4080 super). Audio is fantastic, no noticeable jumps in audio making it a good consistent listen even on speakers. Never crashed on me even during the insanely cinematic secret fights.10/10 game, GOTY contender for sure.",Recommended,756,61.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 20
2249,"Great game. Seeing my childhood super hero in a high quality video is both nostalgic and amazing.The story is good if you don't know much about the OG novel or TV show but it is absolutely amazing if you have prior knowledge. It's an alternative spin to the og story and it is verys refreshing and interesting. The presentation of the story cutscenes are amazing. Not just in-game cutscenes. After every chapters is an animated cutscene with different art-style & animation style. They are all very well made.The enemies and characters are very well designed visually. And the variety is impressive, there are still reused enemies but they still have subtle changes to the mechanic of that enemy. The bosses are mostly great, from visuals to movesets. But the same thing can't be said with the balancing. There are 2 particular bosses that have very cool movesets but for some reasons the dev made them especially tanky while being extremely aggressive. And it's not even about the resistant or anything, they just have a lot of HP. There are bosses that are slow and passive but has no where near the amount of HP that those 2 aggressive bosses have. While in the narrative those 2 bosses are supposed to be challenging but it's disappointed that they resorted to a very lazy way to make them ""hard"".The gameplay is nothing short of amazing, it has a big variety of skills, combos, armor sets and weapons. It's big enough to get you a big amount of builds to test out. It's not something revolutionary but it's good and well made. The maps are mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter that has a little bigger and more open map. The progression system is very good, you almost don't need any farming and will never get under level if you just play the game and explore everything. The game always rewards you with cool items and secret bosses for exploring the maps.This is a great game with very high replayability and even on my first run it took me 50 hours to get like 80% of the stuffs. This is a must buy for Journey to the West fans. And if you like a great action rpg with a unique world and characters this is also great for you. The game feels very polished from start to finish which make it hard to believe this is Game Science first every product. Very well done.Extremely Recommended. Must buy full price.

O cenário de fato é muito lindo, mas não passa de um grande mapa gerado por unreal engine, o personagem mau tem habilidade de andar por esse mapa acidentado e bate em paredes invisíveis o tempo. A história inicial é fraca, não há uma guia de propósito a se fazer, vc só segue em frente o tempo todo. As lutas com os personagens ""não-chefões"" são ridículas (normalmente resolvidas com um golpe) enquanto os ""chefões"" em sí, são desnecessáriamente difíceis (nada na jornada te prepara para esses chefões).

2289,"Very Soulslike, unlike the ♥♥♥♥ some people call soulslike these days this fits the OG definition. The bosses are pretty tough and you'll find yourself grinding on them to get them down, or at least I did and I do play a good deal of these types of games.Character progression feels pretty great so far, though I'm really just starting the game. There seems to be plenty of reasons to backtrack, multiple paths to take, and ways to skip bosses and still progress if you're feeling overwhelmed or under-geared.The best thing about the game, though, is the story. I'm a bit biased because I've watched The Journey to thet West tv adaptation and really enjoy The Monkey King's story. This allows me to put together some pieces that may be lost in translation. This game doesn't replay that original MK story but,, similar to LOTRO, has you follow, revisit, or augment some characters and places that The Monkey King visited in that story.It looks great, and many performance and visual issues I experienced on AMD CPU & GPU when the game launched have been resolved.This really is a MUST PLAY both for lovers of the genre and those who enjoy deep lore even if some of it is lost in translation.

2309,"Black Myth: Wukong er et spill som har fanget oppmerksomheten til mange spillere, spesielt de med en interesse for kinesisk mytologi og kultur. Etter å ha spilt i over 50 timer, kan jeg med trygghet si at dette er et spill som lever opp til hypen. Det kombinerer dyp historie med fengslende gameplay, og jeg vil sterkt anbefale det til alle som ønsker å utforske kinesisk kultur gjennom spill.Spillmekanikk og GameplaySpillet tilbyr en solid action-RPG-opplevelse med utfordrende kamper og en dyp progresjonsmekanikk. Bevegelsen og kampene er flytende, og de mange fiendene og bossene holder deg på tærne hele tiden. Det er tydelig at utviklerne har tatt inspirasjon fra populære sjangere som Dark Souls, men med sin egen unike vri som gjør det både kjent og friskt på samme tid.Visuell PresentasjonGrafikken i Black Myth: Wukong er intet mindre enn spektakulær. Den visuelle fremstillingen av kinesiske landskap, mytiske vesener og atmosfæriske miljøer er noe av det beste jeg har sett i et spill. Hver scene føles som et kunstverk, og detaljene i karakterdesignene og omgivelsene gir en følelse av å være midt i et kinesisk eventyr.Historie og MytologiEn av de største styrkene til spillet er hvordan det dykker dypt ned i kinesisk mytologi, spesielt fortellingen om Wukong, også kjent som Monkey King. For spillere med kinesisk bakgrunn eller de som er interessert i kinesisk kultur, er dette spillet en skattekiste. Historien er fylt med referanser til klassiske myter og legender, noe som gir en autentisk følelse av å oppleve en viktig del av kinesisk kultur.Kulturell VerdiFor meg, og spesielt for de med kinesisk bakgrunn, er det en unik opplevelse å se kinesisk kultur representert på en så episk og nøyaktig måte. Spillet gjør en utmerket jobb med å balansere respekt for tradisjonene med moderne spilldesign. Dette gjør at Black Myth: Wukong ikke bare er et bra spill, men også et kulturelt verk som gir en dypere forståelse av kinesisk mytologi.KonklusjonMed en blanding av utfordrende gameplay, fantastiske visuelle effekter og en dyp forankring i kinesisk kultur, er Black Myth: Wukong et spill som skiller seg ut. Enten du har kinesisk bakgrunn eller bare er nysgjerrig på kinesisk kultur, vil dette spillet gi deg en rik og spennende opplevelse. Jeg anbefaler det på det sterkeste til alle som er på jakt etter noe nytt, samtidig som de ønsker å dykke ned i kinesisk historie og mytologi.Black Myth: Wukong is a game that has captured the attention of many gamers, especially those interested in Chinese mythology and culture. After playing for over 50 hours, I can confidently say that this is a game that lives up to the hype. It combines deep storytelling with captivating gameplay, and I highly recommend it to anyone who want to explore Chinese culture through gaming.Gameplay and MechanicsThe game offers a solid action-RPG experience with challenging combat and a deep progression system. Movement and combat feel fluid, and the variety of enemies and bosses keeps you constantly engaged. The developers clearly drew inspiration from popular genres like Dark Souls, but with a unique twist that makes it feel familiar yet fresh.Visual PresentationThe graphics in Black Myth: Wukong are nothing short of stunning. The visual representation of Chinese landscapes, mythical creatures, and atmospheric environments is some of the best I've seen in a game. Each scene feels like a work of art, and the details in character designs and environments make you feel like you're living through a Chinese epic.Story and MythologyOne of the game's strongest aspects is how it dives deeply into Chinese mythology, especially the tale of Wukong, also known as the Monkey King. For players with a Chinese background or those interested in Chinese culture, this game is a treasure trove. The story is filled with references to classic myths and legends, making it feel like an authentic experience of an essential part of Chinese heritage.Cultural ValueFor me, and particularly for those with a Chinese background, it is a unique experience to see Chinese culture represented in such an epic and accurate way. The game does an excellent job balancing respect for tradition with modern game design. This makes Black Myth: Wukong not only a great game but also a cultural piece that provides a deeper understanding of Chinese mythology.ConclusionWith a mix of challenging gameplay, stunning visuals, and a deep connection to Chinese culture, Black Myth: Wukong stands out. Whether you have a Chinese background or are just curious about Chinese culture, this game will provide a rich and exciting experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new while diving into Chinese history and mythology.",Recommended,3961,41.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 20

The game doesn’t seem optimized either—using frame generation introduces noticeable input lag on the controller, which really affects gameplay.Visually, the game feels oversharpened and ugly,I'm sure I'd enjoy the game as I love the genre and the art style looks really cool, but with so many performance and visual issues, it’s hard to enjoy.

But, the players not only fight the characters - they fight performance issues, they fight input delays, and they fight pretty hardcore lack of hit boxes.

2359,"Where to begin... Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a masterpiece. I can confidently say it’s worth the money. The graphics are absolutely stunning, showcasing meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of the game. While I am faintly familiar Journey to the West's story, you can still literally feel the passion and respect for the lore throughout the entire experience.From the immersive ambient sound design to the intricate level layouts, every element contributes to an unforgettable experience. The gameplay is really fun. Some bosses present a genuine challenge for me (e.g. Yellow Wind Sage and Tiger Vanguard at the beginning, Yin Tiger, Erlang and f-ing Yellow Loong), but overcoming them after many tries still feels incredibly rewarding. The soundtrack is a standout feature that so beautiful, it really deepens your immersion in the game’s narrative. At the end of each chapter, you’re treated to various short film animations, including stop-motion sequences, highlighting the developers’ dedication to storytelling and a great experience.My only criticism would be the lack of maps or direction. I only found out through watching guides that I missed some bosses/quests that I could not go back to, as I had progressed to far ahead. While I understand hand-holding is prevalent in many games, which can ruin the immersion and experience for some, but the complete lack of can sometimes lead to confusion for me. But I guess it also encourages exploration of the vast, beautifully crafted world.Given that this is the developer's first AAA title, the team truly deserves immense praise and respect. I genuinely believe this game deserves Game of the Year, and I eagerly anticipate any upcoming DLC related to this fantastic game.9.5/10",Recommended,1480,76.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 19

The only difference that hit my eye were cool sand and snow effects on PC.And of course battery - Wukong drains it really quickly. Probably 1:15-1:30hrs from full to zero.

2393,"I find this game to amazing for what it is. Unique story which I am not familiar with being from the USA. Art work is awesome as well as the play style. It was a bit difficult to play at the beginning until I figured out the game mechanics better. Ultimately happy with this game considering its not another ""woke"" story based game.The only few things I did not like are that it is missing a map, sorting of items/spirits etc could of been better or at least add an option to list alphabetically since I took the time to back track to figure out what I missed once I completed each chapter. And some bosses later in the game seem to have weird hit boxes were normal light hit moves barely connect so I found myself just swinging away and losing dps because of it. Albeit just forced me to get creative with the build system and skills usage so that negative ended up becoming a plus.I should mention I have played mostly on the steam deck. Honestly, late chapter 3 was a bit a tough because that seems to have been the section of the game where the deck had trouble, few crashes to say the least. Experienced a crash on a cut scene in the beginning of chapter 4, but after that it was running ok.overall great game and getting ready for my first ng+ of this game type.",Recommended,1027,85.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 19

2417,"Black Myth: Wukong ReviewA Game That Breaks Records and Expectations!Black Myth: Wukong is seriously turning heads and setting new records in the gaming world! Developed by Game Science Studio, this game has become one of the most hyped titles, and for good reason. It’s got a jaw-dropping budget of over $75 million, which is a huge deal, and it's taking a unique approach by weaving in elements of Chinese mythology with some really innovative gameplayGAMEPRESSURE.COM.Now, if you're worried that this game falls into the typical Souls-like category, don’t sweat it.

It offers a more balanced experience, making it perfect for those of us who find the hardcore Souls games a bit intimidatingTHE REVIEW GEEK.The combat system is where it really shines! It’s fluid and lets you mix and match skills, magical items, and even some stealth tactics. This makes it way more interesting than just your standard hack-and-slash game. You can choose how you want to approach battles—whether you want to charge in headfirst or take a sneakier route.What’s really exciting about Black Myth: Wukong is how it shows that gaming is definitely not dead. With all the talk about the industry going stale, this game slaps that idea right in the face! It’s proof that there’s still plenty of room for creativity and fresh ideas, especially coming from Eastern developers. Unlike some Western studios that seem scared to take risks and instead add boring elements just to keep everyone happy, Black Myth stays true to its vision, and it pays off big time.It’s refreshing to see a game that embraces its cultural roots without watering anything down. Black Myth: Wukong is a bold statement about what gaming can be, and it’s really captivating with how it brings Chinese mythology to life.aside fromThe fandom is for the 4th Sister, Spiderladies, and most importantly, we're good...In short, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just another action RPG; it’s a game that pushes boundaries. Whether you're a hardcore fan of Souls-like games or someone just looking for a fun challenge, this game has something for everyone. It’s a massive win for Eastern developers, setting a high bar that Western studios should pay attention to.

2445,"I'd like to start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this is. Absolutely phenomenal. Considering that this is the first game from a new team, it surpassed all my expectations.The story is great, I think you can't go wrong with mythology. I was/am not familiar with the story of Wukong, so I do not know if what is being told in the game holds true to the real mythos of Wukong, but I enjoyed everything about it. There are a lot of small tales that you can read about all the characters you encounter during your journey, via the in-game journal, and I really loved being able to read those and get more context about the story of Wukong. I only wish there was a sort of omniscient narrator, but that's just my opinion.The world they created is beautiful, the sights and vistas are gorgeous. You visit a different area in every chapter and each of them had their own beauty and uniqueness. I believe that most of the time, the open world approach is the better one. However the level design in Black Myth : Wukong is good enough that I don't believe it would benefit much from being more open world. There are often many side-paths that you can explore and plenty of secrets and side-quests. As many people have said, this game feels mostly like a ""Boss-rush"" as there are many bosses and sub-bosses, with few enemies in between them. Weaker foes are generally pretty scarce for the most part, and you very rarely have to fight multiple enemies at once. That's a shame because we are definitly given some tools do deal with situations like that but you don't really ever need to use them. I also think that having more instances fighting multiple foes at once can bring a change of pace to the way you fight, making it more diversified, challenging and thus, more fun.The gameplay is not really amazing, but it is more than great, it is really fun. I see a lot of comparison being made with Dark Souls and Sekiro, and while there are similarities I feel like the real inspiration here was Nioh. Dodging is your main way of avoiding damage and is pretty flawless for the most part. Having multiple stances that you can switch between while you are actively fighting makes for some really good action. There's a sort of parry system, which I like, it however needs a bit of work. You can mainly parry in two ways : one is a spell that you can cast instantly, the other is combo-ing an heavy attack into your light attacks as the ennemy hit comes through (this is called ""seeing through"". The first one works perfectly fine, however, when you want to ""see through"" you will very often fail to do so as the heavy attacks won't come out when you want it to due to the light attack animations, making it much less reliable and hard to use properly. I still think Sekiro did it better. The only other big problem I have with the combat is the hit-boxes. When facing really huge enemies, you may frequently miss your fully charged heavy attacks when using the ""Smash"" stance because of the hit-box sort of pushing you away from the boss/Wukong refusing to get closer to the boss. The targeting system could also use a bit of work, but it's not bad by any means.In terms of character progression, firstly there is a vast array of talents that you can unlock, with most of them giving pretty interesting bonuses, enough so that you're always eager to earn more skill points to spend. Like in other Souls-like, you also have equipments such as armor sets and weapons that you can upgrade and curios (talismans) that you can acquire. You can also not only improve but also customise your Healing Gourd, allowing it to grant all sorts of differents bonuses or to restore not just your health but some of the other resources you use during fights.All in all, this is an excellent game, and I very highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys souls-like. In my personal opinion, it is not super difficult, it is not easy either, but if it is challenging enough to keep a veteran of the genre like me entertained for as long as it did, then I'm sure you will enjoy it too.",Recommended,3329,96.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 19

2478,"I'll probably change this to a positive review later on, as the game is actually good and clearly made with a lot of passion, but as it stands, I feel that there are too many people hyping this up as ""10/10, best game ever, GOTY,"" without any sense of objectivity, that mislead others as to what the game is actually like. Therefore, I'm posting this as a negative review at least at first, so as to counter all the rampant favoritism that I feel is being spread around here.Black Myth: Wukong is a Soulslike game, pure and simple. A very decent, graphically stunning Soulslike game, but also a very typical one in its gameplay, which mostly consists of the well-familiar ""dodge roll, dodge roll, dodge roll, left click, dodge roll, dodge roll, dodge roll, left click..."" cycle, again and again, with almost no change for the entire 50-60 hours of the game's duration. You have spells and transformations that you use from time to time, drink a potion if you need to, charge your attack when the boss stops for a breather, and then you dodge roll again. And again, and again...Now, if you are a Soulslike fan in general, and have no problem with what I just described, then this game is absolutely for you. The challenge is there, the bosses are many, they're all unique, and they all possess great visual style.If, however, you are looking for something more in the spirit of God of War, with epic clashes, powers, combos and godly action, THIS IS NOT IT. You won't find that here. It's not like Sifu either. No, this is a slow, methodical and very punishing game, with clunky movement, where 2-3 direct attacks can end you at any given time. A rather questionable choice of gameplay for the Monkey King, who is one of the most overpowered beings in Chinese mythology, but I digress...As Soulslike games are made with the goal of being challenging first and foremost, you will spend a lot of your time in this one alternating between torture and boredom, as you either get your butt kicked by the same boss 10 times in a row until you learn its attack patterns perfectly, or you are exploring a very barren (though admittedly beautiful) world full of invisible walls while looking for the next boss that will torture you, as a silent protagonist with a very unclear backstory. Yes, you read that right, you are a silent protagonist and you won't hear Wukong speak for most of the game past the intro! There are also invisible walls in games in 2024, and A LOT of them too. Why? I don't know, but at this point we might as well move on to the story... (no spoilers)The story here is actually very interesting on a conceptual level! Unfortunately, however, you won't understand a single thing that's going on by simply playing the game, unless you are already familiar with Chinese mythology, Buddhism and the Journey to the West novel, which the game is heavily inspired by. If you have a working knowledge of these topics, or happen to be Chinese yourself, then there really is a lot to appreciate here. If not, then it will just seem like random things happening at random moments, with characters who come and go with no explanation of their intentions or origin. Not a bad thing per se, given that the game is made primarily for an Asian audience who will understand said references, but best be prepared to do a lot of outside research if you want to get even a basic idea of what's going on, as an outsider of that culture.So, there you have it...TLDR: Good game, but not great, made specifically for a target audience that's looking for a challenge at the cost of enjoyment. Somewhat overhyped because of graphics, but with fairly typical/average gameplay for a Soulslike (And invisible walls in 2024, for some reason?). Story is meant to be understood by Chinese people, but is much more inaccessible to others. Play if you like Souls games, avoid if you just want to have fun.",Not Recommended,3195,51.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 19

2483,"Black Myth is what a game should be!I've never been a big fans of souls games because of how aimless the open world concept is, but Wukong is different. The game has souls like elements while still providing a linear yet very challenging gaming experience. You play as Wukong after the events of The Journey to the west and immediately the cinematics do not disappoint. Every chapter (level) offers a different experience on story telling both prologue and epilogue of the chapter. The game is best played in chinese dub with english subtitles as the chinese dub really showcases the amount of love given to the monkey king world. Additionally each level has several sub quests in addition to the main story questline which gives players the chance to explore and discover secret bosses and challenges. These extra side bosses and questlines rewards players with a ton of items/powerups that make the rest of the story easier.For the post game, you enter new game+ which offers enemies with higher dmg and health, however players keep all their items except for key story items and teleport (shrine) points. Upon completion of each chapter players get to further boost their stats and become very OP.Overall this is a game that delivers on what it promises without any paid subscriptions or pay to win features.",Recommended,1090,95.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 18

2489,"Genre: Action-Adventure/MythologyThis game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku.I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.- One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen- Incredibly fun combat- Journal entries are so interesting- Cutscenes are amazing- Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses- Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting- Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but on the other hand chapter itself is really interesting- Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses- Having to search the internet for explanation of some characters that are not in the gameJust an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books. This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played and one of my new favorite games, and I felt so overwhelmed when I finished it. I would advise getting true ending, cause it's worth it. If chapters 3 and 6 had a bit better design I would consider this game a masterpiece, but it's really close.",Recommended,6283,83.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 18

2529,"Where do I begin. I was 19 years old back in 2010 when I left home from Los Angeles to Xi'an, China. This was my first time leaving the country and I went on an exchange program in college, I had know idea I was going to actually learn Mandarin Chinese and learn so much about Chinese culture. Xi'an, China is where the Tang dynasty begin and the Monk Xuan Zang started the Journey to the West from. While in China I saw so many wonderful sights and temples dedicated to the Monkey King and when I heard this game was coming out it was first on my list. I am so happy a Chinese studio made this because culturally everything about this game is authentic and correct. This is a must play game.Now to the actual review of the game. This game is so close to being perfect but the Pagoda Realm and the final boss will certainly add a lot of unnecessary time to the game. I felt at times this game tried to be Elden Ring instead of a simple story game which I felt that since this is an Indie game, they should have focused on fun and making sure the game had a consistent flow. This is my only grip with this game, at times I felt it was unnecessarily difficult. Other than that this game is so fun and it will have you on the edge of your seat. Right now this is the best Unreal Engine game, the graphics are great and it feels like a next gen game. I am proud of this studio and I hope they keep building on this game and make this a franchise. I will certainly play more games from this studio. 后会有期!",Recommended,1204,72.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 18

While it's an interesting and visually impressive fight, it feels unnecessarily drawn out and slightly over-tuned. The challenge is appreciated, but the length of the battle takes away from the overall enjoyment. A more streamlined approach would have made this encounter more satisfying.That said, the graphics are stunning.

This irritated me, as I wanted to play the game my way the whole way through. You shouldn't have to find a very hard-to-naturally-find secret item in order to make the boss somewhat beatable.~ I wish the transformations in the game were evenly spaced out, rather than 1 at the beginning, 1 in the middle, and a ton at the end.~ As an American who has never been exposed to JTWW lore, I wish the storytelling was a little more straightforward at times.

2589,"Combat feels fair. Moveset and Spells are varied enough to allow good comboing into each other. Enivronments are the type that make you stop playing outside of combat and just stare at the detail and art direction of the chapters. Only thing I would have changed is to allow the dodging to still consume stamina, but be able to be used instantaneously mid-combo like it is with dodging and parrying in the new God of War games. I feel it would lead to a more aggressive and fluid combat style similar to the almost dancelike combat in sekiro.Just beat all named enemies through Chapter 2 and can say first impressions are 9/10.",Recommended,516,13.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 18

I don't think many of us expected this videogame to be good (or even real), but I'm so glad it delivered everything and then some. As a work of art, it is magnificent. The gorgeous vistas, the detailed sculptures, the ornate accessories, the chapter end animations and songs (each done by a different studio!) and the chapter end Buddhist mural art are all breathtaking, and remind you that videogames are art. The combat and exploration are excellent, with the latter being particularly praiseworthy- areas keep opening up into new areas and looping back on themselves, making for very satisfying exploration loops.

And boy, did they deliver ?The game is INSANE!! Absolute top notch content! The gameplay, the story, the combat mechanics, cutscenes, the atmosphere, world environment, secret areas. Audio - visual aspect of this title is phenomenal. Several character development paths. I have quite a beefy PCwith 14900K and 4090 so the game was running smooth and stable in 4K for me. Visually it's amazing ;)I live in so called 'modern' Europe but found the story very interesting so i was reading more about the Monkey King during my sessions. Im also delighted to see no woke content here which is simply ruining the game business these days.This is truly an awesome game and for me, very strong candidate for GOTY. I hope Game Science will stay focus and true to their own game vision and will never accept this cancer agandas like sweet baby inc or other dei ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I can't wait for more and looking for upcoming DLCs.

Nothing that I'd expect from an unknown studio.So far, most of the way through Chapter 2, the only complaints are that generally the rank and file enemies are lack luster. The level design is okay, and good in most places, but a little too on rails. There's a lot of invisible barriers. Combine this with the beautiful scenery that as so much detail in it, it makes you think that you should be able to go further into the level than is possibleOh yeah. There's bosses too. They're all wonderful! Some seem to be a push over in terms of difficulty, and some then just have oodles of health, so the difficulty level is a bit all over the place. This doesn't really take away from the bosses, since the actual design of the character and the fight are both very high.",Recommended,773,23.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 17

I had no previous knowledge of the source material, but this game just encouraged me to look into the mythology and lore. I'ts a game that you definitely have to approach with a glass half full mentality to immerse yourself completely. It does suffer from constant invisible walls which are exacerbated by the lack of a map. This is a perfect example of glass half full mentality since this game REALLY encourages exploration and for you to delve into Wukong's Journey to the west to unravel and find some of the best stories, gear and trophies. Camera angles can get a bit crazy sometimes when in combat making it difficult and frustrating and the auto aim also is pretty annoying. Regardless of these gripes this is an awesome game worth playing at least once. I've done multiple playthroughs since it left me wanting more. This game deserves all it's praises and I can describe is as a FLAWED MASTERPIECE.",Recommended,811,242.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2739,"Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning and captivating action RPG that delivers on almost every front. The combat system is fluid, engaging, and rewarding, blending fast-paced, skill-based action with deep strategy. Every encounter feels like a challenge, especially the boss fights, which are truly epic. These bosses are not only visually impressive but also diverse in their mechanics, making each fight memorable and unique. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment after every victory, with each encounter pushing your skills to the limit.The game's lore is another highlight, drawing deeply from Journey to the West and Chinese mythology. It’s refreshing to dive into a world rich in culture and storytelling that hasn't been overly saturated in Western games. The depth of the lore and the attention to detail in the world-building are truly remarkable, giving you a sense of immersion that few other games manage to achieve.What I especially appreciate about Black Myth: Wukong is its focus on delivering a pure gaming experience without any modern political agendas. There’s no forced messaging or distracting commentary—just a compelling game that respects its players’ intelligence and the source material it draws from.On the downside, the level design can be a bit confusing at times. Navigating through certain areas may leave you feeling lost or unsure of where to go next. While the visual design of the levels is beautiful, the layout could have been more intuitive to prevent moments of frustration.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic action RPG that excels in combat, boss design, and storytelling, offering a refreshing escape into a mythological world. If you’re looking for an experience that challenges your skills and immerses you in a rich, politically-free universe, this game is a must-play.",Recommended,1532,36.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

Also there is no map so ,I had to rely on looking up guides on youtube since I didn't want to miss anything.There are some challenging bosses and some fun bosses.Black Myth: Wukong also has some really cool mechanics.This is my game of the year I would give this game 9.5 out of 10!!",Recommended,735,111.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2747,"Black Myth: WukongRating: 5/10 - MediocreBlack Myth: Wukong is a Mediocre action game that could have been so much more than it ended up being. The setting is Great, the graphics are gorgeous - even though the game does run like absolute ♥♥♥♥ - and the combat is decently fun in the beginning. But sadly the game has a large number of issues, most of all that it peaks around and from there it is just a downward spiral of boredom, bosses and level design so it makes the level design of the early chapters - which is already - look . It goes to the point where feels almost insultingly , even if the last boss and the last secret boss are some of, if not , best in the game. Any linear game that has to use invisible walls automatically looses points, it just feels like whoever was in charge of level design had no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue what they were doing. 's combat also doesn't feel that . It is smooth but lacking in variety and depth. It can be quite fun in the early hours but quickly stagnates.Overall is a action game with some souls-like elements, a boring incoherent story, decent combat and some of the most level design I have seen in linear games. It commits the greatest sin any game can commit: it is boring. is nothing special, it does nothing to set itself apart or to: stick it to the gaming industry or the ""woke"" people like some people like to claim",Not Recommended,1107,44.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2759,"Is Black Myth Wukong a Masterpiece ?This is the most beautiful looking game I have ever seen.It's visually stunning and it really comes to life through gorgeous animations of environments, surroundings and models.The gameplay however let me down. Especially the combat. Because while it is fun to be Wukong and play around with the staff, I feel that there is so much more they could have done with this.Movement / CombatThe dodge / perfect dodge mechanic is awesome.The light attack has 1 combo.. That's fine but the fact that you can't combo into something else with it makes it feel boring after a while. Sure you have the see through attack from ability tree and the upgrades for it but is that really it ? I feel there is so much lost potential here..For example: Light attack mid air gives you specific stomp on head attack and then you flip back off. The move is okay. That you can combo it into a heavy attack is cool. However it sucks that it's not its own thing, because it takes away the ability to jump and start attacking normally.The game really feels like It's lacking interesting experimentation with inputs. Like X, square, triangle, circle combinations that you see in action games / fighting games. Only 1 attack for light and another for heavy is surprising and disappointing.Yes stances but they feel limited too. The pole stance doesn't even protect you from attacks below, how and why ? That is just dumb.Then you have the thrust stance, which is kinda fun but again limited.Focus points are fun but what are really the options ? So few.. Also the fact that you have 4 points in the intro fight and you don't in the game EVEN THOUGH in ability tree you can literally unlock 4th focus point and it STILL DOESN'T SHOW UP. Wtf devs ?!Weapon types1 weapon type is basically what you have to play around with through out the whole game! Not even a sword for variety without transforming into another enemy that is somehow capable of using it while Wukong isn't ? So dumb..You defeat a boss and before you now stands a new shiny and interesting weapon that is simply waiting for you to pick it up and become it's new rightful owner. So into the ear storage it goes. Yet, even though it is now clearly under your possession you can't access it outside of a transformation ?!Spirits and transformationsI think the spirits are mostly bad and the fact that you only get 1 attack before you have to wait for what feels like an eternity to use them again, further strengthens my feeling of being limited by the game instead of encouraged to have fun and go nuts.I wish you instead could use any weapon an enemy was carrying (obviously after defeating it). For the bigger/more significant enemies and bosses, those I wish would get added into your transformation pool just like it is with a select few in the game. That way the encounters with enemies would have way more meaning and reward, beyond the idea of increasing will and hopefully getting a good drop. Also the silliness of using 1 attack with a spirit (that might even miss) wouldn't be a factor, as you could instead control them freely for a short period like the others.GameplayThe lengthiness of the game is unfortunately accompanied by too limited combat variety.At least to keep it fresh and interesting for me. I get that the staff has huge importance to the idea of Wukong but no matter how many staffs you put into the game, it doesn't make it any less boring once you reach say Chapter 3.. I would think that for many players the thirst for a different weapon should have set in by then and the fact that the game doesn't satisfy that desire is a huge let down!I do like the combat, It just leaves me wanting so much more and instead of having lots of fun doings lots of different cool things.. I'm left thinking: Is this really it ?!You might say, well what's the point of the transformations then ? The characters you transform into obviously have different moves than Wukong, so it comes down to player preference.It's just too much waiting for access to cool things, instead of having access to cool things more frequent that really turns me off. Especially knowing how long some of the chapters are that they are filled to the rims with enemies.Chapter ends give you items that were suited for that chapterAfter you have completed certain chapters, you are given an item that would have been perfect for that chapter which you just completed ?! This feels so counter intuitive to the gameplay and the only way I can see why they would do this, is for multiple play-throughs. However that would deprive those who only play the game once from it and that doesn't seem good to me. Yes you should be rewarded for multiple plays through a game but the timing of when you receive these items in the game is just weird and feels out of order.Spellcasting failsWhen you cast a spell and for some reason it gets snuffed out ? BUT it actually fully depletes your bar for it so you have to wait for it to charge up again even though you didn't get to use its ability ?! Wtf That is just mega dumb and so bad. From what I can tell, this happens if you are hit while being MID ANIMATION of casting a spell. I have lost count of how many times my spells simply haven't come out due to pretty much unknown reasons and that shouldn't be happening.Enemy damage and stagger statesMaybe it's just me but I feel that enemies do more damage than they should. You shouldn't lose half your health out of nowhere. Especially from how mythical Wukong is made out to be. He is not your average monkey and so how often he has to take a sip of the gourd kind of paints him in a totally different light and makes him look and feel much weaker than he should be portrayed.There is also a really annoying stun lock state that I wish wasn't there.Invisible walls / FallingI wish areas that look reachable actually were and not locked behind invisible walls. Too many times my exploration desires have been met with a sudden access denied. Simply put about falling: If you can't jump off somewhere, an enemy shouldn't be able to push you off it.The prison....What is up with the state you suddenly out of nowhere find yourself in where you start losing life from simply existing ? It also persists through death into your respawn but only sometimes ?!No mapLack of directionIf you can't know whether you are doing a side quest or following the story path, I feel that the game has let you down in not offering you the choice of what you want to pursue.Can't change key binds..ConclusionSo I don't think this is a masterpiece but it goes to show what can be done if developers are given enough time to create what they want and release it when they are satisfied. Which should be the norm as it eliminates time pressure and instead lets devs put all their focus into their creation. Lots of praise to them for all the work, true passion, love, heart and soul that they put into this epic game!Hopefully it will serve as a phenomenal foundation for Game Science to build this universe upon. Because I can't see how they would just kill it now, after the immense hype and interest that it has managed to garner across the globe. The fact that so many people are loving it, should only reinforce their already burning desire to share more of this overall wonderful experience that playing Black Myth Wukong really is.PROS+ Visuals+ Animations+ The dodge / Perfect dodge mechanic+ Music+ Soundscapes+ Story+ Character designs+ Cool armor+ Voice acting+ Bosses+ Overall feel+ SecretsCONS- Repetitive/Limited combat- No weapon variation- Bad rewards for certain things- Too many enemies / Enemy damage / Annoying stun lock state- Failed spellcasting- Insignificant item ""buffs""- No key-bindingIf this had more varied combat or more weapons than just a staff, I would give this a 10/10.From becoming boring instead of flourishing, it gets an 8/10.",Recommended,6489,45.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2793,"The graphics are amazing, but the story is just OKThe worst part is a very hallway and rooms kind of game with no derivation from the programmed pathway forward.Trash mobs to level up on, then a boss, followed by a linear pathway with trash mobs leading to a boss.Later it's worse, linear path to a boss, who has a second phase., Fight 40 times finally win and right into another boss, beat that...nope that boss has a second phase. You just fight over and over until the moves are memorized and ingrained and then...yep new boss fight.A few ""secret"" areas which are pretty darn hard to miss, a few optional bosses which again hard to miss.",Not Recommended,525,736.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 16
2794,"Story 9/10Combat 9/10Progression/Level System 10/10Graphics 10/10Overall 9.1/10This game blew away my expectations, I'm used to hearing all this hype for different video games only to be disappointed as I can be quite picky at times. This one was different the hype is honestly understandable and the game is a true masterpiece and deserves the praise it receives. The graphics are astounding, the game-play loop is rewarding, challenging at times but not entirely too difficult I'd say a good level for most players who enjoy single player games. New game+ isn't necessary but when you do allow yourself the extra time it does reward you with more mechanics and collectibles to make it more rewarding then other ng+ in other games. The story can be a bit hard to follow at times especially if you aren't already familiar with the lore the game draws from but can still be enjoyed with 0 context.

It is not soul game in most of the mechanics, but battles truly are - especially some bosses can be even to the souls hardest bosses (and some even goes further :))Only con is for the story - game expect that you know story Journey to the West. If you never read this book, then you probably wont be able to decipher what is happening many times.",Recommended,505,52.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 16
2809,"Black Myth Wukong is an outstanding game! The combat is smooth, fun, and challenging. It's easier than a souls-like game, but a few bosses require multiple attempts to defeat. The environment and enemy types constantly change as you progress through the game, which keeps the game engaging and exciting.This game does not contain politically correct content, which is great. You can truly escape into this world without being bombarded by real-world propaganda. This shows that the developers care about the story and the game enough to stay true to the lore.However, it could be better. For clarification, I have a CPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D and GPU: RTX 4080 SUPER combo, and I still experience stutters and random frame drops when Ray Tracing is enabled. This is an optimization issue on the game's side, but other than that, it's a great game. I give the game a solid 8.5/10.",Recommended,726,58.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

Sometimes the traversal and level design feels a bit clunky and basic with invisible walls everywhere, but it is not too intrusive. Overall, the game plays enough to its strengths – the boss rush – without the pathways between bosses over staying their welcome. You can tell that the developers who made BMW really cared about the game that they were making and it shines through. I would definitely recommend that you find the missable secret areas in each of the levels or look them up on a guide, they contain some of the best parts of the game : )",Recommended,596,80.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2829,"So, before I continue, this game is basically about 7.5/10 for me. About the level of dark souls 2, which is kinda bad, comparable to ds1, but better than any other game came out that year. Basically somewhat disappointing, hence why a thumbdown.Good stuff:GraphicsEnemy and boss varietyEnvironment detailsGuiStuff to complain about:Firstly, the combat resembles me more of DMC than soulslike. Many enemies and bosses are just damage sponges which often are avoided by chance rather than by skill. Except that in DMC you had many different weapons, and here you just basic attack your way through almost every non-boss encounter.Secondly, the exploration/non-boss area design vary from mediocre to atrocious. Inivisible walls are everywhere, and lots of environment is very same-looking. There's lots of completely empty spaces in latter chapters. This is the first soulslike game which I REALLY wanted to have a map because otherwise navigating through it is terrible.Lastly, the plot is completely nonsensial. It feels like all cutscenes were done some time after most of the game was finished as the game clearly was not designed to tell any sort of compelling easily relatable story.Looking back at all of that, I don't wanna say it's a bad game, especially for a first studio's game, but I also can't deny my mild disappointment and I probably wouldn't buy it for a full price if I were presented with a choice.",Not Recommended,1186,47.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 16

2859,"Took me a while to finish this but I have finally finished this incredible game, Game Science promised a lot and delivered it to its absolute.Story: Just like Elden Ring or any other soulsborn this game’s story is convoluted and intricate, you have to work for the story to understand and read the lore and maybe watch a YouTube video, but the story is fascinating and grandeur. There are plenty of NPCs in the game that continue the story of the game, it’s based on a novel Journey to the West and is full of mythical creatures of all sorts, I had tons of fun reading and exploring about those creatures.Combat: The combat in this game is nothing short of perfection, it’s fluid, quick, responsive and solid. There are multiples techniques for you to use with combos and transformations that let you transform into different creatures that you’ve bested previously. This game has one of the best combat’s I’ve experienced. The best part of the game is the 80+ boss battles which are spectacular to view, hard to fight and a pure satisfaction to beat.Exploration: in extremely rewarding there are so many hidden areas and boss encounters that you will go out of your way to explore every corner. The game’s environment is loaded with hidden treasures, loot and new NPCs. From lush forests to ancient ruins, the realm of Black Myth Wukong is surely a magnificent place to explore, brimming with life and intrigue.Graphics: in Black Myth Wukong are certainly a treat to behold. The magnificent visuals bring the game's environment to life in spectacular detail. From the character design to the surroundings, every part of the game's visuals is a monument to the developers' passion to their craft. Black Myth Wukong is a visual feast that demonstrates the full capabilities of current gaming visuals.Overall, Black Myth Wukong is a masterpiece in game design, a gripping story, absolutely incredible combat, wondrous exploration, and gorgeous graphics.

2895,"**Black Myth: Wukong – Review****Pros:**""Black Myth: Wukong"" marks Game Science's debut into AAA gaming, and what a stunning entry it is! The game is visually breathtaking, with its gorgeous environments and detailed character designs. The combat system is exhilarating, though it can be quite challenging for newcomers. It rewards patience and precision, and the sense of satisfaction you get from perfectly dodging an enemy's attacks is unmatched. Even though there is no parry mechanic, the dodge system feels unique and highly effective, making every battle feel strategic and intense. the sound design deserves special praise as well. From the clash of weapons to the ambient noises of the world, every sound feels meticulously crafted to pull you deeper into the experience. Enemies in the game are diverse, keeping the combat fresh, and the boss fights are particularly notable for their creativity and uniqueness. one standout aspect is the anime-style storytelling that unfolds at the end of each chapter. These moments add a distinct artistic flair to the game, giving it a touch of originality in terms of narrative presentation.**Cons:**That said, the game isn’t without its flaws. Chapter 6, in particular, feels like a bit of a slog. The large map offers little in terms of exploration, and the pacing drags down the excitement that the earlier parts of the game build up. Additionally, Wukong as a character feels a bit too silent and emotionally distant. You never really connect with him on a deeper level, which can make the experience feel more like you're mindlessly fighting bosses rather than investing in the story of the protagonist.**Conclusion:**Despite these few shortcomings, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is an amazing game, and for me, it's one of the best of 2024. I completed the game 100%, which took around 80+ hours, and the journey was absolutely worth it. If you're a fan of God of War or hack-and-slash combat systems, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Game Science has crafted something truly special, and I’m excited to see where they take their talents next.",Recommended,1759,186.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 15

The story is very interesting if you dig into the lore and how refreshing is if you figure out your destiny as the destined one. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something different that is nostalgic in how old games were in plain game playing and figuring the game out while going through the motions of the games cahllanges.,Recommended,487,113.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 15

After a few crashes my laptop straight up shut off. left it for half an hour and came back to switch it on. completely dead. this game killed my new laptop. bricked the GPUit looks ggreat. and the enemiies reacting to heavy attacks is pretty cool. the reasons for the bad review are as followthe combat system and skills seem fun but later in the game they are just punished and become useless. majority of later fights just become a test of endurance as you will run out of mana and light attacks dont do enough damage at all. so you are left to constantly dodge the enemies onslaught of barely readable attacks until u eventually die. i mean 10 attacks with a 1 second delay then another 10 attacks. it becomes a rolling simulator.new game plus then becomes super easy with ring of fire and rock solid spellthe amount of crashes in this game are a nightmare.chapter 2 the end boss is just ridiculous unless u have a secret item u will never find without a guide. i mean the difficulty spike is nonsensical. also im this fight there are invisible walls which the boss can pass through continue attacking u while u cannot touch him. i died to this multiple times. straight up brokenalso input lag or ""not storing inputs"" is a bad design, often a heal or well timed dodge just does not execute",Not Recommended,1170,80.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 15

It was definitely challenging at times (some bosses took me a few more than 5 attempts) but overall not too difficult. Varied areas, super fun bosses, good enemy variety and I think the shrines are well placed throughout. Also I really liked the whole aesthetic and feel of the game artistically.

May update once I reach completion.This game is a bona fide banger.A super interesting story, wrapped inside immaculately presented graphics and sound, cocooned inside a stable and robust client.Feels essentially like all your old souls-like titles with some platforming mixed in. Levels are genuinely massive and, imo, well designed. There is one exception to this rule so far. All I will say is that the Pagoda sucks giant bags of ♥♥♥♥, all day and all night. Although there are some new-ish elements within the gameplay, there's nothing here you haven't done before, it just looks and functions incredibly well. Enemies, especially the bosses, are engaging and artfully designed. Indeed, I think this game can be described as a series of epic boss battles (like +100 of them)Is it worth standard AAA prices......of course not, nothing is.

2979,"Invisible walls galore, Bad bosses. Game feels like a boss rush. Constantly hitting walls of difficulty and frustration with no clear way to even the playing field. I don't know where to travel to at all in the desert area everything looks the same. There's a boss with a checkpoint but no shrine so i had to leave via loading screen to respec at a distant shrine to come back and hope i'm built right. If there's a checkpoint in the boss area make it so i can interact or fast travel out. There's no reason for this as there's like no enemies on the way back its just bad design also you can't use the item to go back to a previous shine as the boss one counts as a shrine even though its not interactable. Gimmick bosses where they go invincible and i just have to watch them or have a 20 second attack where i have to stand on a rock that can be broken by the boss. Not a lot of build variety. Every armour piece is better than the last and with unique modifiers meaning if you find something that complements a skill you like prepare to ditch it when you get an upgrade for a skill you dislike.Stop removing my lock on from bosses in most fights in the game. I don't want to fight the camera as well.Performance wise its okay looks good and not experienced any glitches. I have had few stutters and fps drops as well as my fans constantly running super loud at all times. Chapters 4 onwards was worse.This game has way to many bosses and way too many that fly away and don't come down to get hit. Very scripted boss battles to the point it feels less immersive. There's 113 bosses in this game from the wiki and i've done almost all of them i believe. My strategy hasn't changed since i started and armour barely either after getting the hub at chapter 3. Immobilise is so good they had to make bosses immune to it and scripts that break out of it.Why half way through the game do i get the hub area. It's like 20 hours in to the game if you explore before you get the hub.There's an upgrade drink and gourd at some monkey and the only options after 40 hours i had was 1 gourd and 2-3 drinks total over 113 bosses but you couldn't add more upgradable drinks. There's plenty of gourds and drinks they just don't upgrade for some reason. The final boss removes the new weapon animation you get from the final weapon of the game. Why? I only get the weapon for this boss unless i do ng+ or the chapter 6 side bosses after i get the weapon. 4 hippos and 4 stone golems from breath of the wild.",Not Recommended,2012,47.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 15

3008,I don't get the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I agree more with the many game review sites that gave this middling reviews. Buttons are unresponsive which makes the fights unfair. It is boss after boss with no context as to who I am fighting or why. It might not be a soulslike but the main reason I say that is the combat is too unpredictable and clunky. Souls might not have the most responsive controls but when I press a button I expect it to work.

3009,"The combat system in this game is a mess. The enemy attack patterns lack clarity and have a frustrating ""teleport NPC in front of player during windup"" property that makes spacing a non-factor. The input buffering is terrible, and dodges, which were meant to be the crux of the combat system, are extremely unreliable when interacting with enemies' hitboxes; very often your well-timed dodge will whiff and leave no reward except avoiding damage. On top of that, I don't think that the Focus mechanic is rewarding enough because the hitstun system makes it unreliable to spend.And finally, I don't like how the fact that leveling exists is used as a crux for difficulty design by the developers. You often run into enemies that inexplicably oneshot you, right night to oceans of trivial X-button fodder. So the difficulty progression does not feel designed or rewarding.Black Myth: Wukong is just one of those overrated games on Steam IMHO.

Mechanics run deep from equipment, to healing to combat. This all wrapped into a package that is by far the best looking game i've played. I've run chapters multiple times just to admire the scenery. The game is challenging but not impossible , loved the system whereby you dont need to go around looting a thousand chests - instead gear is dropped more or less after a boss encounter which enables you to progress to the next.in addition, i ran this game on max graphic settings but a pretty mid range pc and i never had any frame drops. Extremely well optimised and made for an enjoyable experience all round.

3077,"Product received for freeStarted very well, got bad very quickly. It IS a souls like indeed, don't get confused by the marketing and what many people are saying. If you're planning to buy the game and don't like souls level hardships, unfairness and rage-inducing gimmicks, maybe redirect your budget on something else.Have I become the only gamer who doesn't find endless trial & error and grinding a massive boss' healthbar for 10 entire minutes fun? Is there anyone else who feels much more rewarded by beating a boss in just one or two attempts after an engaging, focused and fair fight that forces you to play well and use all the mechanics that the games has to offer, but doesn't force you to learn the boss patterns by heart through endless repetition and a dozen unfair deaths, just to finally beat him because you finally had some luck?Chapter 1 is perfect at doing what I just described and I enjoyed it a lot. Difficulty was well balanced there, fights were engaging, challenging and fun without ever getting frustrating. But in chapter 2, suddenly, it becomes a proper souls like with a massive difficulty spike, bosses with endless health bars that barely take any damage but have endless combos that can destroy yours, camera issues that become your enemy more than the enemy himself.I was halfway through chapter 3 and got to the Pagoda Prison boss, that's where I uninstalled the game. After beating a stupid massive dragon in a totally random way (because the fight itself is purely random) and having to go through the most annoying level design ever in the prison, here we are with another huge, annoying boss with an almost invulnerable health bar... no, thanks.Moreover, exploration gets so damn confusing from chapter 2 and a lot of rage-inducing elements are copy-pasted from Dark Souls and randomly introduced. To make it even worse, the environments are just not at all impressive. Chapter 2 is just red rocks everywhere, chapter 3 is just snow everywhere (excluding the prison, that's awfully confusing to navigate and definitely not fun to explore).Everything gets repetitive, frustrating, infuriating and uninteresting very quickly, and it's a real shame because the combat system is very fun to use in fair fights, the design of the enemies is really inspired, the general atmosphere of Chinese mithology is fascinating, but that is not enough. A game needs to be fun in the first place and this one stopped to be after less than 20% of its length.I feel like From Software has ruined the action genre as every action game nowadays borrows the WORST souls-like elements just to follow this damn trend. I'm sooo sick of it.P.S. I market the product as received for free because I got a free code with my Nvidia graphics card.

3085,"Fazia um bom tempo que eu não jogava um jogo que me fazia pensar nele por 24hrs.O jogo é lindo, cada cenário passando pelas estações do tempo, cenários secretos, historias de capítulos que tem sua conclusão em sidequest, o carinho que os devs colocaram nas conclusões de cada cenário é de bater palmas, você fica incrédulo de tão bom que é jogar e saber mais sobre as coisas do mundo.Finalizei o jogo sem ser humilhado (petrificar e pegar meu porongo), mas no NG+ e NG++ fui humilhado e sempre ficava com o sorriso no rosto. Erlang foi o boss que eu mais morri, fiquei frustrado, mas consegui passar. O capitulo 4 para mim é o mais lindo e aquela historia é o beijo do chef.Platinar esse jogo não foi cansativo, foi divertido, deveria ter platinado no NG+ (sou curioso e ficava vasculhando os locais), quando terminei a primeira run so faltou 10 conquistas, no NG+ por burrice minha esqueci de pegar um bau importante, mas mesmo assim, no NG++ é onde fica com mais dano os mobs, e começa a ser desafiador de novo, e fui me aventurar mais uma vez e platinei. Sinto que não tem mais nada, vazio, vou ter que tocar na grama?Como um um amigo aqui da steam falou:''Valeu cada centavo''.English:It's been a long time since I played a game that made me think about it for 24 hours.The game is beautiful, each scenario goes through the seasons of time, secret scenarios, chapter stories that end in sidequests, the care that the devs put into the conclusions of each scenario is applause-worthy, you're in disbelief at how good it is to play and learn more about the things in the world.I finished the game without being humiliated (petrified and taking my gourd), but in NG+ and NG++ I was humiliated and always had a smile on my face. Erlang was the boss I died the most, I was frustrated, but I managed to get through. Chapter 4 is the most beautiful for me and that story is the chef's kiss.Platinuming this game wasn't tiring, it was fun, I should have platinumed it in NG+ (I'm curious and I kept searching the places), when I finished the first run I only had 10 achievements left, in NG+ I was stupid and forgot to get an important chest, but even so, in NG++ is where the mobs deal more damage, and it starts to be challenging again, so I went on an adventure once more and platinumed it.

3095,"1. Overall Score- 5/102. Recommended- No3. Game ScoringA. Graphics- 10/10 Obscene amounts of effort went into stage design, graphical fidelity, and photo realism in this game. Small details abound in every texture and the game is generous with its capabilities. This is Unreal Engine on display.B. Setting- 9/10 As an avid fan of the Journey to the West story, and Wukong specifically, I loved the idea of playing the titular Monkey King in a game that did more to capture him in his traditional sense. Though the story makes little sense, as apparently Wukong being defeated and killed is practically impossible, it was an interesting idea to relive his life in an alternate style. His precocious nature shines through in everything you do.C. Mechanics- 3/10 This is where the game instantly begins to falter heavily. The story and graphics alone cannot hold this game up, no matter how amazing they are. The game seems to function more like a challenging boss adventure RPG lite. The mechanics usually seen in most Souls games are generally missing, and sorely missed here, with a lack of endless level and customization, wide variety of combat styles/weapons, and a fair amount of missing progression, the game feels less like a souls like and more like a Hack and Slash.D. Combat- 2/10 The combat is just one of the major issues in the game. I am torn, due to the fact that, as the Monkey King, you seem to fight as if he might, twirling your staff for epic strikes, interlacing magical spells and abilities while striking quickly, and getting buzzed to heal himself. The issue is, with no real defensive measures, your dodge is the only thing you have, and its iframe window is rather small, considering most bosses either stall attacks, or have difficult to predict, very lengthy combos. Also, its not long before you reach a point where you fight a boss that breaks lock on, and becomes ethereal while still doing dmg. NEVER a good design choice.E. Gearing- 2/10 Again, I'm torn. What is the Monkey King without Jingu Bang, the extending iron staff? And true to life, all you get is a staff. Yes, you might have 3 particular stances to fight in, but they are secondary to the basic, same combo you spam against all other enemies. Though you do get 4 armour pieces, with set bonuses galore, and a couple accessory slots, in general, they are usually nothing more than stats and cosmetic. Nothing is farmable, only acquired, much like most action rpgs, by defeating key enemies. So, for a long time, you might be stuck in the same gear, with no real way to improve yourself or the gear.4. ProsA. Sun Wukong. The Monkey King. As a playable character. Not an adaptation, not a inspired by character, the actual Monkey King. That, in and of itself, is a Pro.B. The graphics might actually make you think your watching a live action film that you are somehow controlling. The fidelity is awe inspiring, and the stages themselves are glorious to behold. Fantastical Ancient China brought to life is a spectacle.C. The story, seemingly taking place after Wukong's ascension, becoming the Glorious Fighting Buddha, means its an inspired sequel to the epic Journey to the West, which means you get to meet some of the characters during the game that were escorting Wukong during the Journey. Always a treat to see such care given to the original story.E. A myriad of spells and abilities show off alot of the interesting skills Wukong learned, and was able to utilize to his advantage in every fight he partook in. Many of these abilities are shown in the game as well, and remarkably well done at that.5. ConsA. The actual gameplay, moment to moment is jarring. You go from exploring immaculate scenery with minor enemies that offer little in the way of real combat, to suddenly getting completely wrecked by some wandering boss stuck in a corner thats completely optional, or getting stuck being pummeled by a story boss that is utterly overtuned in multiple ways.B. The lack of any real weapon choices makes the combat boring and repetitive. You use mostly the exact same combo form beginning to end, and not rally gain any semblance of new attacks except on rare occasions when unlocking a new ability in a stance skill tree.C. There isn't really a heavy attack system, as your heavy attack requires focus, which is gathered by doing damage with light attacks. After which, the heavy attack is usually the same, breaks the light attack combo to add a spike of dmg, and can apply some different effects, based on the stance.D. Practically no progression in terms of core stats aside from a few limited skill point unlocks, gearing is your mainstay for increasing your damage, health, defense, and survivability. And since the game is fairly limited in terms of gearing, the progression is painfully linear.E. A massive amount of the bosses combos can chain for an above average amount of hits, striking out at you in large areas 7-10 times. Many of these combos can even set you into a snowball of defeat, as the boss is able to strike you while you are recovering from a previous hit, and unable to move or dodge or defend. Sometimes, a boss can drag you from full health to less than half is you get hit by the first strike, with no way to stop the combo, or avoid it mid sequence.Edit #1. Bosses with Frame skips to enable perfect tracking. How much worse can you design your game?Edit #2. A boss that literally breaks lock on as a feature? Even shouts ""fooled you!"" as he does so? REALLY bad game design, and its 100% purposeful.",Not Recommended,4569,29.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 14

3113,"After spending over 70 hours perfecting my playthrough of Black Myth Wukong, unlocking everything, and taking on all the challenges, I can say the game is a visual masterpiece, but it’s not without its hiccups. The Unreal Engine 5 really shines here every environment, from the lush forests in the opening chapter to the frozen mountains and scorching deserts later on, is breathtaking. The game’s atmosphere and art direction make you want to stop and just take it all in, especially in areas like the Temple Ruins or the visually striking Chapter 5’s snowy landscape.Combat and GameplayThe core combat feels incredibly satisfying, especially when facing off against some of the game’s larger-than-life bosses like Erlang Shen or the Duskveil monster. Each boss has beautifully animated attack patterns, and learning these movements is key to mastering the game. What I loved most is the transformation mechanic, which gives you the ability to switch between various forms mid-battle, adding a lot of depth to the combat system. The way the game pushes you to experiment with different playstyles keeps things fresh even after dozens of hours.However, some aspects of the gameplay fall short. The levels between boss fights can feel bland and linear, with little in the way of meaningful exploration or diverse enemies. While the boss fights are epic, the minor enemies can feel repetitive after a while, and the crafting system for weapons and armor seems almost pointless. There's no real incentive to upgrade gear since the changes are marginal at best. I found myself relying more on skill and transformation abilities than the gear itself.Story and LoreThe story is heavily inspired by Journey to the West, which is fitting for a game centered around Wukong. The cutscenes are beautifully animated and seamlessly blend into the gameplay, offering cinematic moments that are genuinely engaging. That being said, the storytelling can feel fragmented, with important narrative details hidden in cryptic dialogue or lore entries that many players may miss unless they dive deep into the journal system. I found it intriguing, but some might find the pacing and delivery a bit obscure, especially if you're not familiar with the source material.Performance IssuesOne of the most frustrating parts of my experience was the performance. On high-end systems, the game struggles with frame drops and long load times, particularly in more graphically intense areas like dark caves or boss arenas with complex lighting effects. This made certain encounters, especially mid-boss fights, more challenging than they needed to be because of lag spikes. For a game so visually impressive, the lack of optimization was a noticeable downside.Final ThoughtsDespite its shortcomings, Black Myth Wukong is a phenomenal action RPG that offers an immersive journey through Chinese mythology. Its breathtaking visuals, fluid combat, and unique transformation mechanics stand out as its strongest aspects. If you're willing to overlook the fragmented storytelling and performance hiccups, the game is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. It’s one of those rare games that leaves a lasting impression long after you’ve finished it.This is definitely a game that rewards patience and skill, and I highly recommend giving it a try, especially if you're into deep, mythologically inspired RPGs with a Soulslike feel.",Recommended,2868,71.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 14

3116,"Would the Prologue: Journey to the West be a MMO game?lol just hoping they can make a better sequel.As of now, I've unlocked all achievements and had to say it did a great job, with a lot of room for improvement.The game was created using the top notch tech, but without PTR nor a test version for player feedback.Which can be translated into: eye-pleasing but lacking the game balance.There were times that I had to fight one single boss for long hours.Just one boss, and there's nothing else to do in the game except that boss. It became very frustrating.Pros:- snow, waterfall, lake and sand are realistic- scenic and zen, love the historic buildings and temples- narratives and stories are philosophical- great boss designs, graphic and combat systemCons:- unable to adjust down game difficulty- straight line game means that once stuck at a certain boss, nothing else to do in the game- gathering seeds from plants are tedious, had to reload game to adjust PC system time to get plants re-spawn- some abilities are overpowered than others, the four elements: poison, fire, ice and shock were not balanced neitherOverall:$59.99 should be a price for the game that I can play for hundreds of hours, with devs update regularly. This game has no communicate channel with their devs team. Devs really need to listen to players feedback, dive into the gamer's community, rather than living in their own world.Wish it's a mmo, it's okay to have a bit grinding, but we need the freedom to test different skills on the boss that we prefer.",Recommended,1273,160.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 14

(and bad one at that) No parry, no block, no riposte.No iframes, BUT ENEMIES HAVE THEM.Combat is tied to LONG DELAYED ANIMATIONS, DODGE WILL NOT CANCEL YOUR ATTACKS.Enemies have delayed attacks too, so you never really know when they will attack you, unless you die to them few times. Then you can kinda tell.Game heavily relies on your active skills (which have cooldowns ffs), not on your reflexes or intuition.Bad target lock, weird FOV, hitboxes sometimes wtf.Technical issues. Bad performance in relation what the game is trying to do.Stutters no matter your system with RT enabled. Game looks bad. No visual clarity. You cant see what is on your screen most of the time. Visual clutter everywhere, bad exposure. Looks more like a movie than a game, and in a very bad way.REGRETING BUYING THIS. I dont even know if I can finish this.

I didn't encounter any major bugs or issues either. Story is really tough to follow but the game presents it in such an enigmatic way that you would just wish to go in and find more about it.And personally, I don't think this is a boss rush sorta game. Yes, there are a huge number of bosses and mini-bosses to fight and they are the main attraction, but it's not the only thing going on when it comes to enjoying the experience. Even the regular enemies, while not insanely challenging, are varied enough to keep you on your toes and the areas between bosses is surely not a snoozefest.The different skills you gain can really alter the experience and best thing is they have decided to let users respec whenever they want to. That's really something I wish more games would have.Overall, the game is awesome, I highly recommend playing it.

3166,"I'd love to recommend it, there's good points and it's a stunner visually. However, irritating technical issues far overshadow the good.Invisible walls. Silly me thought those were a relic of the past, well they're back with a vengeance. This game is painfully riddled with them. It caused many an eye-roll when it turned out that flat ground in front of you was actually inaccessible.Saw your heavy attack hit the boss smack-bang, right into its back? I guess you imagined it because that caused zero damage. There are a couple of bosses this will happen with over and over, and over again with. You know the hitboxes are pure trash when you're missing a bear the size of a house.I started to be convinced that there was just something wrong with my controller. I'd have to smash the heal button before Monkey would actually take a sip, for some reason this wasn't an issue in early game but in later bosses it sure was.These things might not seem like a lot, but when they are causing you to lose when otherwise you would have won and there are over 70 bosses in the game? It gets old.The first two chapters were the hardest because those are before you get your broken spells/abilities. There's literally things that will allow you to skip an entire boss phase. That said there are some cheap things bosses can and will do, such a grabs that seem unavoidable, and tracking so good that even if you dodge a move, the boss will instantaneously spin around and hit you anway.I basically only got through this game because I'm stubborn and I love Journey to the West.",Not Recommended,1288,94.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 14

Im looking at YOU Phantom blade zero.With its ARPG approach with certain souls elements it was a fun ride to go through, I was going into this game expecting it to just be like any standard souls-like but it doesn't quite hit that nail on the head to fit into it other than the generic archetypes that you find in that genre.From start to beginning the quality of each boss fight was widely engaging and had me wondering what each one would end up being like the further i got into the game, especially with the variety that comes from all bosses than it being simply a large human with a sword.I do wish there was more engagement from the cast throughout the game, shoutout to Zhu Bajie my absolute GOAT of the entire story and his arc that you have with the spider ladies. For once in that entire story the Spider arc & connection for Zhu baije was genuinely the best part of the game story wise.. i would be telling a lie if i said it didn't get me emotional.Overall this game does a great job at making a fun ARPG with an interesting fighting loop until you've essentially mastered it.. to slowly get bored of it towards the very end. The animations between each chapter and the secret ending wrapped up this game perfectly for me.Once again, i love you zhu bajie",Recommended,1176,41.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

3239,"Honestly the best game of the year. Not gonna lie, I died a lot. But it does become worth when you finally defeat a boss & you go ""YESSS I DID IT!"" It's the best feeling. This is a hard game & I've never played anything like it. I'm more of a front fighter that likes to overpower & finish the battle quickly. Did not expect that for each boss, you had to change up your skill tree every time. I love chinese mythology & Sun Wukong's story is one of my favorites. So when I saw the trailer, I was hooked. I didn't care what I was getting myself into.In terms of combat, it doesn't help that much when you need stamina for things like sprinting, jumping, charging, dodging. It took some time to learn the mechanics of the game. Like I said, I died a lot & I mean a lottt. I had to take a huge step back from my normal play style to study each boss by just watching them & their combos midfight. You get an oportunity, then hit them, wait & watch, rinse repeat. Each fight took its time, but honestly the hardest bosses were Erlang & Wukong's broken shell (the guy was a major jerk, typical of Wukong's character).I went through the game 4 times & completed everything. I got all achievements, did all the quests, explored everything, obtained max level, max stats, maxed out the skill tree. I even went so far as to max out most of the spirit tiers & upgraded all armor sets (only the ones that gave a set bonus at mythical). And, finally the Wukong stance after getting all the relics. Alas, all good things must come to an end & I must move on. I had a blast playing this regardless of the difficulty level.",Recommended,1300,204.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

It has some challenges but overall if you're a Dark Souls fan that has beaten all the Soulslikes etc. you're in for a very easy time. Still give the game super top marks, it is easily one of the most gorgeous games I've played in a long time. The combat is very fun and engaging and provides lots of options to adjust to your enemy. Being able to change your build at the drop of a hat is a great feature that makes the game not feel restrictive with how you build your character. Lots of secrets to discover and hidden bosses galore, can't recommend enough for people that enjoy trying to touch every corner of a map.",Recommended,635,66.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

Black Myth Wukong is a beautiful game. From the way it plays to the graphics, to the very core of the lore. It was perfected with the utmost care. 81 hours in and I am just 100% it and will be happily playing through the story a couple more times to get to max level just because it is so much fun.

3305,"I want to like this game, but it's grossly unbalanced when it comes to boss fights, where difficulty levels ratchet up incredibly unevenly. It makes getting past certain points an obnoxious chore, especially if your life isn't just button mashing all day. There should be difficulty settings, better balance between enemy types, a more linear leveling system and a much better approach to explaining character attributes and stats. That this game is being lauded by certain players and reviewers is real indictment of how bad the gaming scene is right now, because in 2018 this wouldn't been seen as a particularly great game. It might be beautiful, with fabulous aesthetics, with some core game play that could be pretty great with tweaking but, as is, it's grossly overrated.",Not Recommended,650,6.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

3310,"Black Myth: Wukong presents itself as a visually stunning epic, but for me, it felt like gilded repetition. It looks great—until it doesn’t—and the gameplay loop quickly wore thin. There’s definitely an audience for this, but I’ll revisit it only when it's discounted and, ideally, optimized. As it stands, it feels less like a thrilling myth and more like a chore list with expensive lighting.Gameplay: A Beautiful Hamster WheelFrom what I played, the gameplay boiled down to predictable patterns: follow the path, fight some uninspired enemies, and reach a boss who at least tries to make things interesting. Lather, rinse, repeat. It reminded me of an old-school Nintendo game—only with a thousand extra pixels and double the frustration. You’re given no real reason for why everything must die, just the sense that existence itself is an offense. See monster. Kill monster. Move on. If you’re into strict patterns and linear progression, you’ll feel right at home. I was hoping for more creativity, but instead, it’s monkey see, monkey slay.Graphics: When Pretty Becomes PainfulThere’s no denying the visual ambition, but ambition alone doesn’t cut it. Running this game with an RTX 3080 felt like trying to run a marathon in dress shoes. Even on the lowest settings, it was plagued with artifacts and tearing, which made the whole experience disorienting. A shame, really—what I could see was beautiful, but I was too distracted by the glitches to appreciate it. It’s the kind of beauty that demands perfection, and when perfection falters, it crumbles quickly.Sound & Voice: A Mixed Bag of StaticThe voice work? Well, it’s there. Some performances were fine, but the protagonist’s voice wore on me faster than I expected—imagine a celestial being with the soul of a whiny intern. I get that it’s supposed to add character, but instead, it added an itch I couldn’t quite scratch. It wasn’t unplayable, but it certainly didn’t help keep me invested.Final ThoughtsI can see why some people love Black Myth: Wukong, but it’s not for me. It’s like a museum exhibit you can’t wait to leave—impressive on the surface, but exhausting when you stay too long. If it hits the $20 mark and gets some performance fixes, I might give it another try. Until then, I’ll leave the Monkey King to his existential crisis and hope he finds peace—preferably without me.",Not Recommended,1965,0.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

3379,"The Unexpected Masterpiece!So, where do I start? After sinking over 106 hours into this gem (including an NG+ run because once clearly wasn’t enough), I have to say—this game is an absolute BANGER. Game Science has outdone itself, and I’ll be honest, AAA studios need to be taking notes. Enough with their Microtransactions and “Oops! You accidentally locked the real ending behind a $30 DLC purchase”—just give us a game, man!Every chapter in this game is like unwrapping a new present. The difficulty feels perfectly tailored to whatever mood you're in. Feeling invincible? Crank it up. Got emotional baggage? Maybe dial it back. It’s all there, and it’s all beautifully crafted.That said, I do have one gripe (because of course, nothing's perfect). Some areas feel like they came straight out of an empty void, devoid of anything interesting. I mean, if I’m trekking across the vast wastelands of this majestic world, the least you could do is give me a shiny trinket or a creepy lore tidbit to chew on. Nope, nada. Some places are so barren that you’d think they were reserved for some DLC, and let’s face it—they probably are.But hey, those moments aside, this game is an absolute treat. A contender for GOTY? I’d bet my level 100 character’s gear on it.This is a must-buy and must-play. Forget the negative reviews and the people crying about it. Play it for yourself, be your own judge, and enjoy the ride.",Recommended,1172,106.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 13

3503,"9/10 if you like Souls-style dodge-dodge-dodge-hit style combat, 8/10 otherwise. The combat is slightly faster paced than tradition Dark Souls but not quite to the point of pure button smashing, and some bosses give sufficient challenge. Note: there is no difficulty slider so if you are bad at souls combat, you might face a few walls. Build variety is marginal but there are few different abilities to choose from and tricks to learn if you want to get good, but you don't really need to learn any combos to beat the game.Graphics: Decent on regular monitors, surprisingly bad on HDR capable monitors. The game has weird dark grey fog filling all dark places and corners that clears up as you walk near, which is very jarring on displays with good black levels. The game intentionally makes you half-blind in dark places for no reason and negates any advantage of having an OLED display. Regular displays are less affected because they cannot portray dark areas properly anyway.Story: Simple and functional, few annoying cases where the player is defeated in a cutscene but overall works very well for a game like this where gameplay is the focus. Leans a bit into lore, but not so much that you would need to read the journey to the west. Characters are good, even the sidekick is a rare case for not being annoying and useless and has some touching moments.The game earns a lot of style points. Lots of art and optional lore to be read, and the chapter ending cutscenes are especially cool. The game is very trimmed in a good way: no babbling comedy characters, no useless dialog (main character does not talk, which is the best thing ever), no stupid monetization attempts, no grind (unless you really want to), no pure cosmetics. The game does not even have a map, which actually makes exploration much more enjoyable, and the main route is simple enough to follow that you won't get lost in the semi-open world. However, you will likely need to check guides to get every secret boss fight.In short, Black Myth Wukong is an old fashioned game in every good sense. Technically not very original, but the foundation is solid and the setting is fresh since Chinese mythology has been rarely explored in videogames.",Recommended,1834,39.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 12

3532,"At this point in time, I cannot recommend it. It's one of those games you buy because everyone else around you likes it, so you try it and then ultimately hate it. This is the case for me. I might come back to it later at some point, but I currently can't stand it anymore.Runs like a** even with my 4080/13700K setup without upscaling and FrameGen. I play in 4k. You can literally see the frame drops with the naked eye.What annoyed me the most, however, are the following:* Dialog is absolute cringe and I can't listen to the annoying af main character anymore. He makes my ears bleed and gives me brain hemorrhage. The constant shrieking, yelling and boasting is just so cringey.* Story telling is your average overblown exaggerated mythical adventure nonsense with ridiculous character designs and extremely exaggerated power dynamics. Like, I get it, it's a mythical story, but this isn't Dragon Ball Z, where this would feel appropriate.* Combat is... weird. I understand that I'd need more practice to get into the flow, but I just couldn't get into it. I absolutely dreaded the moments when I had an opening after dodging the bosses' spam, only for my character having to switch stances first before he would actually attack. Wasted windows of opportunity, and his attack range always felt too short. The limited Mana was also annoying because some of the special abilities, while cool to use, often felt wasted because of the aforementioned problems. It's not that I find the fights too difficult, but that I'd often find myself fighting the combat animations/design more than the actual enemies. It's just frustrating.* Speaking of bosses, I really, really dislike the level design. Constantly, and I do mean constantly, I'd roam around and suddenly find myself in a boss arena for a boss I wasn't even ready for yet. And you'd just get sucked into a cutscene before you could do anything about it. Maybe fresh out of heals, too. Then get clapped straight into respawn. Great stuff. This is why fog walls in the Souls games were really good. Lots of invisible walls and the whole area is basically capped off into a big box for you to explore before you move on to the next chapter. Many times you'd come across areas where you'd think ""that looks climbable"" and then realize, nope, just another invisible wall. This has the direct effect that every level you enter feels much, much smaller than it looks.* One last thing. I really did not feel connected to the story/the game as a whole. Like, I was playing through the levels, but yet it felt more like playing through a tech demo rather than an actual game. Everything just feels so disconnected. You get a few cutscenes, do some random sh*t, then explore for a bit, get more cutscenes, maybe kill a boss, then you get more cutscenes, drop into the next level, get an introduction to a new mechanic, then the whole thing starts over. To me, it just has zero flow.For the record, I stopped playing after the lightning spamming boss that came a bit later after that white beast thing.I don't know, man.

Whilst you're forced to watch how you become a pincushion, because you cannot staff spin due to stagger stagger stagger...Then this is the game for you !Combat is shallow, lacking substance.It feels you start with negative 800 poise, whilst most enemies have 5 million.I bit into the hype of this game, being a Souls veteran - but this is the first time I felt dissatisfied after killing a boss.And that says a lot in my opinion.",Not Recommended,630,81.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 12

3577,"Im almost at 40hours played in this game already and cannot recommend it enough. The lore is super fun, the combat is fun to watch & graphics are amazing.It’s a souls-like, so, has a bit of skill curve. But if you can get used to the timing for dodges and have a super basic knowledge of the hitboxes you can mostly coast through this game.I dare to say it’s similar or better than elden ring (dont come for me on this, this is personal opinion). Less open world concept, more linear, similar to god of war. not quite as difficult as ER, however, In term of bosses, there’s less grind to beat bosses. More entry level, but still has great replayability.11/10",Recommended,538,104.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 11
3578,"A truly awesome game and an amazing first project from a studio. And from China as well, so that gets bonus pride points from me.Amazing unique setting that draws on Journey to the West, fluid combat, varied and complex skill and gear system that allows for different builds, and lots, LOTS of bosses to fight. Mechanically, the game is very clearly inspired by Souls games and other action games like God of War, and it's equally satisfying to play.The story is good, but a bit too cryptic to understand. Unlike fromsoft games, where its esoteric feel of the setting contributes to the game's atmosphere and invites poetic interpretation, Black Myth's setting is based on a very defined Chinese Mythical setting with a lot of established backstories, and I think the game could have benefited from explaining some more instead of just throwing everything into the in-game wiki menu.One major complaint I have is invisible walls, there's way too many and since this game hides a lot of secrets in its levels, I often had to bump everywhere just to check if I can go there or its just another invisible wall, which is pretty frustrating. Another complaint I have is a bit personal: most bosses felt too easy to me, I feel like I only need to learn the moveset of like 5 or so bosses to beat them and the rest can often be brute forced by just mashing dodge when enemies are attacking and throwing every skill at them when their cool-downs are over.Overall a pretty great game. Here's to more projects like this from China in the future!",Recommended,1265,40.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 11
3579,"Product received for freeBlack Myth: Wukong – The Apex of Unreal Engine 5 MasteryRating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5)Pros:Graphics: The visuals in Black Myth: Wukong are absolutely stunning. From the detailed environments to the fluid animations, everything feels meticulously crafted, making the game a visual treat, especially on higher settings.Originality: It's refreshing to see a game that delves into Chinese mythology with such depth. Black Myth: Wukong stands out for its unique storyline and the immersive world built around classic mythological figures.Story: The game offers a captivating narrative based on the journey of the Monkey King. It's filled with intriguing characters, unexpected twists, and memorable moments that keep you hooked from start to finish.Dialogues: The dialogues feel meaningful and add weight to the overall experience. They deepen the story and provide a better understanding of the world you're navigating.Controls on PC: The controls feel responsive and intuitive on the PC. Whether you're dodging, attacking, or using abilities, everything feels smooth and fluid.Balanced Difficulty: The game strikes a fine balance in terms of difficulty, making it enjoyable for both seasoned players and newcomers alike. There's enough challenge to keep things exciting without feeling overwhelming.Cons:Boss Fights: While the boss battles are intense and challenging, some fights — particularly against gigantic bosses — can become frustrating when you get cornered. The sheer size of these bosses can obscure the screen, making it hard to gauge what's happening and plan your next move.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong delivers a visually impressive and captivating experience. It's original, offers a compelling story, and feels great to play on PC. While some boss fights may be a bit overwhelming due to their scale, it's still a must-play for action-adventure fans looking for something new and exciting.",Recommended,1634,67.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 11

3589,"I honestly don't understand why this game did well. It looks pretty and some boss fights are fun, but that's it. Having completed it, I just can't recommend it.1. There are bosses and quests that can be missed after progressing to certain points for no reason whatsoever. This sort of design should've been thrown out years ago. If something is going to become missable then give the player a prompt so we can do what we need to do first. I'm not going to do NG+ just to kill a handful of bosses that I didn't get to experience.2. Whatever story is trying to be told, it's failing to be told. Badly. I had absolutely no idea what was going on for the entire play through other than I'm collecting relics belonging to Wukong. Everything else was just nonsensical because nothing was explained. The story hinges on you having intimate knowledge the original myth. Perhaps a Chinese audience will appreciate it but if the developers wanted to appeal to a global audience, they should've taken into account that we're not experts.3. Combat gets repetitive.4. The world is very static and empty. You have next to no impact on your surroundings which I personally cannot stand in an adventure game. If you kill a mythical being, you kind of expect there to be some sort of consequence. Maybe not for every boss but at least some of them.This game would've been great if they'd just taken the extra effort to educate its audience about the characters and plot points of the myth they were referencing. Because they didn't, it felt like I was just going place to place killing stuff in my path. Even with the end of chapter bits where you're shown a tapestry of the things you saw, it still doesn't lend itself to explaining what you've just done.",Not Recommended,1430,51.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 11

I hated the guys that attack with vines in the snow area, and once you find them, you will probably know what I am talking about.Furthermore, the final 3 boss fights (The way I played them) are pretty annoying. Not hard, annoying. They break pretty much every rule of the game and that is never fun, especially if it is established that most bosses will play with the same rules you do. I can think of 5 bosses that just break the rules and do whatever they feel like, and it was always a frustrating experience when this happened.Last but not least, the story was pretty cryptic. I know FromSoft does this all the time, it does not make it good guys.I have played every PC available FromSoft game and basically have given up on the stories, this is one part of the souls series game devs should avoid.Even with all the above said, this game is trully a masterpiece.

3615,"Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a visual masterpiece. From the moment you start playing, you’re thrust into a breathtaking world inspired by Chinese mythology, filled with awe-inspiring environments, intricately designed creatures, and an atmosphere that feels alive with ancient magic. This game is a triumph in both its art direction and its ability to immerse players in a fantastical journey. It’s easily one of the most visually stunning action RPGs I’ve ever played.The combat is just as satisfying as the visuals. Wukong’s abilities, whether it’s transforming into different creatures, summoning magical powers, or wielding his iconic staff, feel powerful and fluid. Each enemy encounter is engaging, challenging you to think on your feet and make use of Wukong’s wide arsenal of moves. The boss battles, in particular, are jaw-dropping—each one is not only a test of skill but also a visual spectacle that will leave you on the edge of your seat.The story, rooted in the legendary Journey to the West, is beautifully told. The narrative blends elements of mythology with creative twists, making each moment feel like you’re stepping into an ancient tale. From Wukong’s mischievous personality to the world’s deeper, darker themes, the game excels at keeping you invested in its plot and lore. The rich world-building is complemented by stellar voice acting and a soundtrack that heightens the sense of wonder and adventure.However, despite all the praise I can heap on Black Myth: Wukong, there is one frustrating quirk that slightly tarnishes the experience: invisible walls. The game presents such vast, open landscapes—rolling hills, towering cliffs, and mysterious forests—that beg to be explored. You’ll often find yourself spotting what looks like a perfect path to explore, only to run headlong into an invisible wall. It’s jarring, especially in a game that does so much to make you feel like you’re in a living, breathing world.The issue here isn’t just that these invisible barriers exist—they’re common in many games—but it’s how much Black Myth: Wukong excels at creating a sense of freedom, only to have that illusion shattered by these invisible restrictions. It’s a small gripe in the grand scheme of things, but there are moments where you’re pulled out of the immersion because of it. You see a cliff or a path that looks like a shortcut, and naturally, you want to take it, but instead, you’re blocked by an unseen boundary. It feels a bit like the game is teasing you with its gorgeous landscapes, only to reel you back in.That said, this issue is not game-breaking but it’s more of an occasional annoyance in an otherwise phenomenal experience. Once you get back on track, the game quickly draws you in again with its fluid combat, dazzling visuals, and compelling story.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is a truly groundbreaking game that sets new standards for visual fidelity, combat fluidity, and storytelling in action RPGs. Its world is rich with mythology and detail, making every moment feel like you’re part of a legend. While the invisible walls occasionally disrupt the immersion, they’re far outweighed by everything the game does right. If you’re looking for a game that delivers both substance and style, Black Myth: Wukong is an unforgettable adventure worth every moment.",Recommended,2787,40.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 11

At first i was pissed at the game for how hard the bosses were and stopped playing it entirely, but after a day or two i tried it once more and got better results than before, This game improves your combat capabilities, However the only frustrating thing about the game are its achievements you have to play the game multiple times to get all the achievements, other than this minor setback.

3622,"One of the best games I've ever played. The visuals, theme, story and game play are extremely beautiful, fluid, engaging, and fun. It is pretty easy and straightforward to pick up with varying levels of difficulty as you progress through story. The bosses have different degrees of difficulty with unique fighting styles and phases. As you engage with the map and terrain you'll find gorgeous scenery that matches the vibrant aesthetic and story that the game designers were going for. I would have liked to see more interaction with the terrain like ability to climb trees or interact in different ways. So far, though, I would say this is a 10/10 game.",Recommended,543,8.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 11
3623,"I love everything about the game. Beautiful art, great gameplay, heart tugging emotions, you get the whole package. The difficulty was actually not bad, as long as you learned the mechanics of the game. I learned the lesson a little late in my first play-through.Scorpionlord was my opp. He was the reason I actually learned the mechanics of the game instead of trying to brute force it. Even the ebon flow transformation did not do anything against him. And so I got good. Yellow Loong took me 7 attempts. Erlang took me 4 attempts. Scorpionlord killed me more than 15 times.Ng+ is a beatdown and I am so happy to have the skills and the powers to beat down all those pesky bosses in the first three chapters when I was but a poor monkey.

Because most enemies starts their attack animation slower and ends it faster, so sometimes I'll just spam the dodge button, that time it's hard to get perfect dodge. Other than that this game combat and upgrade systems are awesome and good story line with amazing anime style cut scenes at the end of each chapter and secret story and boss fights.

The point of NG+ (I assumed) is to make you more OP yet on the contrary it makes you feel like a a new born baby.

3819,"Excellent game. I love the combat. There is enough variation to not get stale without getting too lost in the weeds with different play styles. Allowing infinite respec highly encouraged trying different builds but you don't get limitless upgrade materials until NG+ so that was a minor negative.The graphics are beautiful, the game runs very consistently for me at max settings in 1440p and maintains a solid 80-100 fps. The bosses are great. When you really get good at utilizing the different stances and switching between them, its incredibly satisfying. I've 100%ed the game, I'm almost done with my NG+ run and I've encountered no bugs, no glitches, no frame drops or stutters. This is how you release a high quality finished product. The story is interesting but I did find myself thinking ""wait, what's going on?"" throughout my first playthrough. It isn't the clearest storytelling I've ever experienced but it never failed to keep me entertained and interested. This is simply a very satisfying game to play and get good at.NG+ was honestly way too easy. By the end of the first playthrough, I had completed every objective and crafted every armor piece and weapon that can be crafted/upgraded before NG+ so I was strong as hell. I blazed my way through NG+ so fast and almost none of the bosses even stood a chance. Erlang was still a decent challenge of course but everyone else was a piece of cake and they all got wrecked in what seemed like 20-30 seconds. All in all, this game rocked and I hope they do a sequel, prequel, whichever. I enjoyed the writing, the voice acting was great, the characters were pretty interesting, the combat controls were excellent. I really couldn't have asked for much more from this type of game. A few more branching paths, secret areas and hidden bosses would always be appreciated but I thoroughly my time playing this game.

The level of detail in the environments, character and item models is pretty damn awesome! The amount of invisible walls is kind of annoying but not enough to ruin the immersion and fun.It's worth mentioning that I'm running this on a beefy PC and it still seems to struggle sometimes with performance in cutscenes and when entering new areas.

Sadly this game is let down on so many levels... Without going into the tedious chapter design and at times totally boring zones. This game is mostly let down by infuriating boss mechanics and poor button mapping and button delays. I cannot explain how many fights i've lost because a command didn't register on my controller, shameful hit boxes in enemies favor, lock on being cancelled because of some cheap enemy off screen vanish. I cant explain how many times I've CLEARLY seen an attack land and not register. This whole game is built around spamming one attack and hoping for a heavy which are almost impossible to land because enemies literally don't stop...I will beat this game to prove a point and I hate leaving things unfinished but the ride has been more stress than fun in my opinion.

3858,"If I could give a mixed review I would, but seeing how many reviews are praising this game I will play devil's advocate.The game is soo cinematic and aesthetically great (the OST bangs), but in comparison the combat feels hollow and there's some very frustrating design choices.A lot of reviews compare it to GoW and I agree, but I think GoW specifically does the skill tree significantly better. The skill tree in almost every case feels boring, I don't want to manage 5 different skill trees, with 3+ sub-trees, especially when a huge percentage of the skills are incremental percent changes. The GoW skill tree specifically shins in comparison because every many skill points are a new tool to add to your combos and tool belt. Meanwhile, Wukong is locked to 1 light combo with only 3 possible variations (all being limited by the spirit gauge) just feels hollow, 3 heavy attacks with long windups only available after tearing the spirit gauge. Of the hundreds of skill points you can invest, only 6 unlock new moves. Having 3 separate mechanics to increase stats, the celestial fruit, skill tree points, and gear also seems redundant.That also brings my next frustration which is the weapon upgrade tree. Upgrading your weapon with a newly discovered material will lock you out of a different tree, unless you are willing to lose almost all the materials spent upgrading. Just allow people to craft separate weapons each time.My final complaint is the camera and some boss designs. Like most souls-likes, the camera is bad. But worse than the average soul like, in an attempt to be cinematic, the camera has inertia. When a boss is locked onto, and flies off screen or above your head, the camera will attempt to follow, but in the process, both your character and the boss will be off screen. This becomes wildly frustrating when you end up fighting 3+ flying bosses back to back. Additionally, most bosses are just damage sponges, which on its own is fine, but becomes very obnoxious when you fight flying bosses that only give you a damage window every 30+ seconds.Overall like 6/10, 10/10 cinematicly and graphically, but the frustrating combat design choices have me question if it is worth completing. I kind of would rather just play Sekiro or GoW",Not Recommended,1873,19.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 10

3879,"this game had a lot of potential, especially with the combat aspect. the combat mechanics are obviously poorly made and not thought out. its a basic spam the same move type game and mostly relies on abilities to either stun bosses for as long as possible or get as much damage in as you can while they cannot attack you. this is made obvious when fighting the bosses, as every single one was made with a similar idea: be as annoying as possible.first of all, movement. the dodges in this game felt hard to grasp, even after having hundreds of hours in souls-like games. the immunity frame window is small and you can still be hit nearing the end of the roll. movement in general is clunky and makes wandering around the map while having to deal with lesser enemies really frustrating, especially when actually fighting them. its most noticable in boss fights which includes the distance from where wukong engages with attacks and that there are no jump attacks, just a thrust away.speaking of bosses, they are the most infuriating in terms of mechanics. after coming from games like elden ring and dark souls, where enemies usually take their time and wind up their attacks, it took me some time to adjust to the opposite in this game. but it honestly gets out of hand later in the game. bosses have no indicator at all for when they are going to attack which leaves you always uncertain when you should attack or not. if its not a fast attack, its a weird wind-up which is hard to predict when it actually hits, as stated before, it hits instantly. its confusing to play between quickly dodging to waiting to dodge. combos done by bosses have attacks which are horribly spaced out which makes it hard to dodge the whole thing because of the small immunity frames. however, the most annoying part is the amount of times you get stun locked during combat. some heavy attacks from bosses have the ability to completely sweep you off your feet, which forces you into an animation of getting up which takes around 5 seconds and you cannot dodge or jump out of it. in addition, in elden ring for example, even if you are recovering / dodging and you press your flask button, you still drink it when you get out of any animations and are available to do so. in here, you cannot. this left me in many situations where i press the button to heal but it does not do anything and end up dying shortly after. combat also gets very repetitive and boring and stances are very situational. i also often get cancelled out of my heavy attacks because bosses hit me and i stagger, which is very annoying.the world is unpleasant to navigate. its full of invisible walls which make paths harder to spot, especially in chapter 4, where its almost impossible to know where the right way to go is. there is no indicator where to go in most of the game, other than the little smoke trails to the shrines. enemies are spammed throughout the games free world which makes it especially annoying discovering areas or running back to bosses, since in most boss fights the enemies can actually get into the arena and damage you, resulting in a stun lock and death. the game explains the story in a confusing way too, the 'movies' at the end of each chapter are entertaining and well made, but do not speak to me.in conclusion, this game is not balanced at all. i admit that it is a good game for the company, seeing how the only other games they made before this one were for mobile. however, good graphics dont necessarily make a good game. 5/10",Not Recommended,2880,52.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 10

The environments became more linear and but somehow harder to navigate because of how everything blends together to well and I found it harder to backtrack because everything looks the same with no distinct landmarks. The bosses jesus chapter 3 sucks for bosses and even the mini bosses just became lazy. Like I hated that multiple bosses hinder you in some way so you cant use the tools the game gives you. One arena has mud so you can hardly move, one boss is flying so much you have to dodge and wait a long time just to get like 4 hits in, and another boss completely disables your abilities or turns them against you, if you use the spells you have he goes gold and immune to damage until you break it.

3935,"To the point=========================A fun but obnoxiously long souls-like that just seemingly decided boss difficulty randomly.Good Stuff=========================- Can't deny that the game looks great and each of the areas in the game are beautiful, perfectly complementing the lore and settings with lots of ways to explore- There is an incredible amount of content and the maps get larger every level culminating in a fantastically huge final level. Personally, this annoyed me by the end but for people that want to hunt for secrets and collect everything there is an amazing value for your money here.- The combat, once you figure out the ebb and flow and usage of focus points/varied combos, becomes very fun with you getting to take full advantage of Wukongs repetoire. This gets enhanced further as you continue to get more and more spells and transformations through out the game.- The music is usually very subdued but I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It seems to really pick up during tense moments in fights as opposed to other souls-likes where you get nonstop latin chanting after going through a fog gate.Bad Stuff=========================- Boss difficulty is all over the place. Some bosses in the final chapters are absolute jokes compared to ones in the earlier zones. I'd be surprised when I got stuck on some optional sub-boss only for the chapter boss to get mowed over.- The 4 banes, this games status effects, are layered on so thick in the back half of the game, it gets incredibly annoying. For instance, on one map, nearly every enemy poisons you and does so in 2-3 hits. On another zone, it's nearly every enemy having hte ability to set you on fire. Don't get me started on the many many bosses that inflict status effects, as most of them seem to inflict you instantly and constantly meaning if you miss a single dodge it completely changes the fight. It would be great if they lift up less aggressively.- A map. ♥♥♥♥'s sake does this game need a map. The aforementioned levels are massive and it's very easy to take a wrong turn and get lost or miss one of the games many obtuse secret areas.- Theres a big amount of invisible walls, which I understand is somewhat of a necessity, but there are a lot of them placed in spots where you'd imagine you'd be able to explore. Without the previously mentioned map, this can make aspects of exploration frustrating.- For those unfamiliar with Journey to the West ( like me) a lot of references are just completely wasted or things make no sense.

3948,"Meh. I dont get the hype, This game realy isn't that amazing. Granted ive only just started and gotten through a few bosses. Ill definitely change this if i feel different. Only good things are: graphics, boss fights and the theme (how it connects to the cultural side).MOVEMENT: traversal feels ok, but nothing to write home on. Very basic and hardly any ""monky-like"" Movement, which i think they massively missed out on. (Should have taken a page from any Prince of Persia game)FIGHTING: disapointed in the fight styles, though i suspect my opinion might change later in the game once i unlock more, though so far pretty meh. boss fights are pretty difficult, though some are extremely easy, with your special powers. For atack combos, i expected a bit more out of to make it skill bassed, but you end up just waiting out most of your enemy attacks for an opening.SKILLS: some skills are ok. But could do with better explaination/translation, because they could mean many things.ENEMIES: bosses are sufficiently difficult, but non-boss enemies were a huge letdown. Many are pushovers, but they dont get staggered after your first hit, so you need to wait to attack again, and i guess they dont always do alot of damage.This would be ok if there was a better quantity of enemies. I feel like the start they are so scattered and too few, i might just be comparing it to other Souls likes but, in other games, getting to the boss room felt more like an accomplishment in its own right, where in this it feels too easy. Some of the larger enemies are basically bosses too.CONCLUSION: rather get Nioh 2. More difficult, more weapons, more enemies, more variation.Games this could learn from: Nioh (enemy diversity, weapon diversity, fighting styles, difficultygetting through an area), Prince of Persia worrior within (traversal, fight styles), mortal shell (achievement of getting though an area), Eldenring (open world), lords of the fallen 2014 (weapons, enemy diversity)",Not Recommended,1642,3.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 9
3949,"After unlocking every achievement in Black Myth: Wukong, I can confidently say this game is a must-play for action-RPG fans who love a challenge.PROS:- Stunning Visuals: The environments and creature designs are breathtaking. Every area feels alive and steeped in Chinese mythology, making exploration a joy.- Challenging Combat: The combat is tough but incredibly satisfying. Mastering Wukong's transformations and abilities is key to surviving intense, skill-based battles.- Engaging Story: If you're a fan of Journey to the West, you'll love how the game expands on the myth. The story is immersive, with deep lore that you unlock as you progress.- Rewarding Achievements: The achievement system is well-designed. From secret bosses to hidden areas, every achievement felt like a real accomplishment. Completing the game at 100% is truly satisfying.CONS:- Difficulty Curve: The game can be brutally difficult at times. While that’s part of the appeal for many, it may be frustrating for those not used to tough combat. For example: I died more than 120 times trying to defeat Tiger Vanguard but after defeated him, I realized that he trained my game senses, how to dodge, use spell in a right time.- Some Pacing Issues: A few areas I can feel I get lost because there was no map, so it was a difficulty to locate where am I, and how can I get out off there.Final Thoughts:Black Myth: Wukong blends challenging gameplay with beautiful visuals and mythological depth.

The reward, shop and talent trees systems are all interesting with many different aspects to experiment with and unlock. You feel good stat progression and evolution for your character, eventually building an overpowered warrior, much like the wukong himself.Lots of content with large levels, everything is included in the one package for a great action adventure gaming experience, even if this is not your style of game, It's worth a buy solely to bare witness to the graphics.

3953,"My GOTY 2024. Very good optimization for the quality of graphics and incredibly fun and novel combat mechanics. Mostly very well made bosses. The equipment customization and numerous build possibilities allow for great customization, from glass cannons to tanks. Only criticisms being some bosses (especially 4/6 end-of-chapter bosses) have unfun/cheese gimmicks to them that leave a ""finally this is over"" rather than ""what a great boss"" feeling at the end of the fight. After completing all achievements a few are more annoying than others- particularly gathering seeds (complete rng) 3 curios that require farming plants (limited time gated resources) with more rng; and a few armor pieces which are random enemy drops. Also an armor set/weapon that requires almost 2 full playthroughs to fully craft (for seemingly no reason). Overall worth every penny spent.

4012,"An incredibly fun and exhilarating action game with phenomenal looking cutscenes and camera work in fights that remind me of an action movie. This was an incredible second game from Game Science, and absolutely lived up to the hype. It plays somewhat like a souls-like with a single weapon (a combat system based around a single weapon type and a dodge with I-Frames, where dying revives not only you at the last in-world checkpoint but enemies where they were originally found), combined with the powerful abilities and magics that enhance how you fight. I have run the FromSoftware catalog into the ground and will continue to for decades, but this game managed to breathe life into a genre I adore.The exploration is hampered by chapter 1 being laden with invisible walls, and does not prepare you for the exploration slowly opening up as the chapters progress. While the game becomes much less linear throughout its life, it does still include the invisible walls in later chapters, further creating confusion in what is and isn't traversable. While there are quite a few opportunities to get lost, the invisible barriers are my biggest complaint of the game as a whole, and in my opinion doesn't detract from the fun it does deliver.The bosses are done very well, with surprising yet fairly telegraphed attacks. The progression of bosses also feels like the developers knew how to ask and prod you to get better and try new techniques, but still allows you to win if your favorite methods come from the first chapter.The story isn't overly involved, but it is there and the optional bosses do add some lore. Every enemy is also accompanied by a lore page that adds small details. The graphics are astounding whether we're talking about gameplay or cutscene, and each chapter has a graphic gift at the end that I don't want to spoil.Game Science has also proven that they know how enemy design can't stay stagnant throughout a game like this. They have also completely shocked me with the brutality of the final boss, they hold nothing back there. Game Science also just elevates the pure fun-ness of the final secret bosses and left my jaw on the floor.

4035,"The game really isn't what you'd expect. It's really pretty, that's a given, but that's about it. The level design isn't clear and is full of the kind of invisible walls that make little sense. The combat is much more simplistic than you'd expect, with most of the variety coming from limited-duration transformations. My biggest gripe is the story. Granted, I'm pretty unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but the game provides little to no context regarding what is going on or why. For example, you meet a guy with a big gourd on his back early on. Ok! I heal from a gourd! Does that mean I get a tutorial on how to upgrade my healing item? Nope! He writes something on your gourd and now you can apparently eat ghosts or something in exchange for super moves?

4053,This game MIGHT be one of the best game I've ever played (after rdr2) the gameplay was really good really fun combats not too hard beside some bosses. But the main part i like about this game is the story the story was absolute amazing (no glaze) it doesn't feed you the story like rdr2 you actually have to go defeat bosses to understand what's going on. Also this game isn't just a single story it is the story AFTER what happened in the original novel journey to the west so if you do want to play this game you can search that in youtube first to understand what happened during Journey To The West and play this game you will experience the game a lot better and there are a lot of places you won't understand unless you've read the original story so please if you are thinking to buy this game and play it just buy it don't hesitate but if you want to understand the whole story you gotta know what the original story was about.,Recommended,756,76.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 9

I totally recommend anyone who is hesitant about this game to just buy it.

4064,"Black Myth: Wukong é uma experiência inovadora no mundo dos jogos de ação. O que mais chama a atenção é a maneira como ele traz elementos de jogos soulslike, mas sem se render completamente a essa fórmula já conhecida. A gameplay é fluida, estratégica e ao mesmo tempo oferece uma liberdade que vai além do que se costuma ver nesse gênero.O combate é intenso, exigindo habilidade e precisão, mas a variedade de movimentos e as habilidades do protagonista, inspiradas na lenda do Rei Macaco, dão uma nova dinâmica à jogabilidade. O jogador não fica restrito apenas a esquivas e ataques convencionais, há toda uma gama de opções para adaptar o estilo de luta conforme a necessidade, o que torna o combate mais dinâmico e menos previsível.Os elementos visuais são outro ponto forte. O jogo apresenta um mundo belamente construído, inspirado na mitologia chinesa, com cenários impressionantes e criaturas que misturam o épico e o sobrenatural. Cada ambiente tem uma riqueza de detalhes que faz você querer explorar e descobrir mais sobre esse universo fantástico. A atmosfera é complementada por uma trilha sonora que captura perfeitamente o clima das batalhas e momentos de exploração.O grande diferencial de Black Myth: Wukong é que, mesmo incorporando aspectos que lembram os soulslike, ele não se limita a seguir esse caminho à risca. A dificuldade e os desafios estão presentes, mas de uma forma que se sente mais orgânica e menos punitiva, permitindo que o jogador se envolva na história e nas mecânicas sem sentir que está apenas repetindo fórmulas antigas.No geral, Black Myth: Wukong entrega uma experiência refrescante, misturando o melhor de um jogo desafiador com a inovação necessária para não parecer mais do mesmo. É um título que vai agradar tanto aos fãs de jogos mais exigentes quanto àqueles que buscam algo épico e diferente.",Recommended,1540,21.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 9

Truth is this game is fantastic, it has a LOT of lore, you can learn about just every single character you encounter and every boss you encounter. The game is honestly really fun and enjoyable but it has one clear big bad thing in it in my opinion, and it is the crazy jumps in difficulty spikes at points, sure some bosses are meant to be harder, but this game goes from like 4/10 difficulty bosses to 7/10 or 8/10 difficulty bosses, I might just be bad at the game, but it really felt like some bosses are unnecessarily way harder for no apparent reason and there isn't like a gimmick to beat that harder boss, you just have to try until you kill him.

4097,"Best game I have played in 2024 and the best blackmyth-like video game out there, even though it might look like a traditional souls-like from a first glance I assure you it's very much it's own thing while having some souls-like elements. The areas are incredibly well designed with lots to explore and entire secret areas hidden in each chapter without being overbearing and still being linear. The combat system is streamlined while also leaving a lot of room for experimentation since respecing your levels comes without cost and can be done form any Shrine (this games bonfire system), there is a lot of depth in this games progression system.Even though there's not many different types of weapon movesets and most weapons only follow the basic staff/spear moveset each weapon still has a mildly different playstyle when paired with this games vast amounts of armorsets, talismans, drinks/soaks(things that boost your flask) and different combinations of spells and spirits you find throughout your playthrough, you can freely make tons of cool builds mostly centered around the ""Four Banes"" more commonly known as ailments, this includes Thunder, Scorch, Frost and Poison. Every single armor set in this game is masterfully designed and you wont stick with the same outfit for long since after every prominent boss/enemy you defeat you will be able to craft a corresponding weapon or armor set with the materials they drop. And changing armor sets is advised from a gameplay perspective as well since every set you can craft will most likely be a direct upgrade from the previous, sometimes having a bonus effect that comes with it.Definitely the main selling point of this game are the bosses which there are a ♥♥♥♥ TON of, so much so that this game can be considered a boss rush because there's mostly a very small amount of mobs in between main/side bosses. That aside you wont find bosses with such distinct mechanics and animations in any other game, Since this game is so graphically beautiful obviously so are the boss designs but not only do they look good, most bosses in this game have very cool and fair moveset aside from the usual few frustrating ones where you cant seem to hit them because of their hit boxes; this is mostly an issue with bigger bosses, or the camera bugging out and getting stuck in either the arena or the boss itself again mostly an issue with bigger bosses, which to be fair there is a lot of but these are merely minor inconveniences compared to how much boss variety this game offers. The final boss of this game by himself makes this game a must play from me, one of the coolest bosses I have ever fought from the sequences leading upto him to the spectacle of a boss fight it was till the conclusion cutscene, it was absolute CINEMA.The story is a little complicated to piece together if you are unfamiliar of Sun Wukong's Journey to the West but the masterfully animated cut scenes and music videos are a spectacle and vaguely make you understand what transpired.This game is a must play if you like fast paced action RPGs.",Recommended,2541,43.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4139,"8/10Great visuals. Lots of creative areas to explore and interesting bosses. I've gotten to 100% achievement and just finishing up NG+.The boss fight mechanics are disappointing. Dodging barely works, so you end up overpowering most bosses with spells and transformations, rather than trying to go toe to toe with them. Many spells (e.g. pluck of the many) take far too long to activate, so you get hit before you can use them. Using a gourd is very buggy during boss fights - sometimes you have to hit the 'use gourd' button 20 times before your character uses it. The Erlang fight is very buggy. Your staff sometimes pass right through him and he does damage even when his blows clearly miss. The story is largely incomprehensible without doing a lot of background reading into JTTW. There needs to be more to do other than boss fights. Chapter 1 boss fights are way too hard relative to your power/skill level. I almost rage quit early on. The bosses are much easier in Chapters 3-5, which is the opposite of how it should be. Chapter 6 is a mess. A huge, largely empty area. Looks unfinished. Not good enough for a AAA title.",Recommended,929,123.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4143,"Rise, Destined One & become God MonkeBlack Myth: Wukong wastes no time in throwing you into the action as you take control of Sun Wokung, the Monkey King rebelling against the celestial court. Here you get a small window into all the powers you'll eventually obtain throughout the game. After the duel with Erlang seems to conclude, the time of Sun Wukung ends and after ages pass, a nameless monkey rises to the task of re-obtaining the powers of the Monkey King to finish what he started.As the nameless monkey (aka The Destined One), you start with nothing more than the martial prowess to hit things with a staff & the power to perpetually re-spawn at the last shrine you've visited. Granted you'll get a few new tricks early on but like any Souls-like, you're own familiarity with combat moves/timing of both you & your enemies will be a required skill throughout this journey. Dodging & to a lesser extent stamina use will also serve you well despite any new powers or combat stance you may want to try out. This may sound like a lot and it kind of is, but the game eases you in to each new power & you're encouraged to respec as it's free to do at any shrine so experiment as needed.Enemy variety is a highlight in this game with each area showcasing threats that thematically match what's around you. In a creepy forest? Expect bug assassins waiting to drop from the treetops to attack. Near a volcano? Here's a few fire mages to rain fire from above. Typical From Software stuff but impressive to see with a new studio. Most bosses & sub-bosses are enjoyable to tackle with unique dialogue at times depending on your actions & some really cool bombastic attacks for even the more obscure encounters. Fights never feel truly unfair & can be overcome to some extent with some extra leveling.Map/level design is fantastic, each area has a great sense of history & what's happened in the wake from the end of Sun Wukong's rebellion. Abandoned temples, crumbing kingdoms or ruins partially consumed by nature. References by enemies & various destruction in environments also lend to world-building. Each side path or side quest is all designed with purpose with an optional boss battle or secret area to be reached. Note that there is a significant amount of easily missable side content, and while there's new game+ available, I do recommend reading some kind of guide if you want to see everything. (I'm serious on that last sentence, there is literally content that would be nearly impossible to find on your own.)Soundtrack is really good, it gives a sense of adventure, excitement, & grand scale if that makes sense. Sort of reminds me of something like Lord of the Rings. Voice acting (at least for English) was far better than I was expecting, there really was an effort made to match the dialogue to lip sync and the actors did a great job all around. I would imagine Chinese would also be very good with subtitles to add to the experience. Graphical fidelity also looks exceptional with a very high level of detail even with common enemies or random objects littered throughout the map.Naturally all this comes with a performance price but the use of Unreal Engine here does allow for good scalability, you aren't really losing much even at the low preset. Although I can't say this will entirely eliminate any kind of UE stuttering during traversal. For those using NVIDIA GPUs, you will need to replace the DLSS DLL file as it's outdated which you can do fairly easily by downloading the newest version online or using DLSS Swapper. NVMe drive over a SATA SSD as the installation location is also something I recommended to ensure sufficient data streaming especially in the later chapters. Note that any NVIDIA driver update seems to also require a rebuild of the shader cache which takes a few minutes to wait for.This game can easily be anyone's personal GOTY & may also be mine (we'll see with Silent Hill 2 out now). The fact that a new studio in China spent years accomplishing this AAA single player experience is incredible, especially when considering how focused most Chinese gaming companies are on the mobile market. If you're a fan of Souls-likes or character action games, you really owe it to yourself to play this.",Recommended,3506,60.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4172,"This is not the traditional type of game that I play. I usually like turn-based games like X-Com. As I have gotten older (I'm now 61 years old), I have avoided FPS and any games that relies on fast accurate reflexes and reaction times. I am just terrible at those types of games.However, I am also an ABC (American Born Chinese) and was intrigued by the rave reviews that Black Myth: Wukong was getting. I am not familiar with the ""Journey to the West"" stories either and I thought it would be cool to play this game to learn a little bit of my heritage.Okay, long story short: I am having a ton of fun playing this game. Right now, I'm at about 37 hours and I am at the beginnings of Chapter 2 so I'm taking a long leisurely time playing it (also because this is not the typical type of game that I play so I'm not good at it compared to a lot of other people).To my surprise, I have been successful at beating more bosses and getting further into the game than I thought possible. I sort of expected to be stuck at the first boss and eventually quit in frustration.However, the game seems to allow the user to eventually be able to beat any boss by allowing us to gain experience (to gain skills) and freely rearrange our skills so that we eventually get to the point where we can beat a boss. At least, that's my hope.And it's really satisfying when you do beat a boss. I have encountered 2 or 3 bosses where it took me awhile to either figure out how (or be lucky enough or gain enough skills) to eventually beat them. If you encounter a boss you can't beat, you can just go around beating lesser opponents until you can level up and gain a skill that might help. And I have encountered some bosses where I was able to beat them on the first try.I am fearful that I will eventually encounter a boss that I can't beat and quit the game. I hope that with patience, I will be able to beat all the bosses I encounter and be able to finish the game. I really hope that I can finish the game.The game is very polish and beautiful. It even plays and looks great on lesser hardware (I'm playing with an Intel Arc A380). I'm having a lot of fun and I find the story to be interesting (although a lot of times I don't really know what is going on since I am not familiar with the source material). It has given me interest in learning more about the source material it is based on. I'll probably end up watching some of those Journey to the West movies with Stephen Chow (I did see one awhile ago and I remember that I thought it was very funny and entertaining but I will probably enjoy it more now as I slowly learn more about the Monkey King myth)Overall, I do highly recommend this game.",Recommended,2169,100.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4195,"Having finally beaten the game I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the best new games this year.The combat is great. At the start of the game it's easy to get fooled into thinking the combat doesn't have much variety, but the further into the game you get, the more items you unlock, the more you level up, the more the combat system really comes together. You can change your weapon stance to switch between different heavy attacks and other combos, you have a lot of different spells that can completely change the way you approach combat, and there are several transformations that change your moveset entirely. You can even customize your healing in multiple ways, which is a really nice addition. By the end of the game I had several different ""builds"" I could switch between depending on the situation, which is helped by the fact that the game lets you respect all your upgrades for free at any time, which is something more games should do.The game's difficulty is at a pretty fair level. It is much easier than a lot of the games it gets compared to, like Dark Souls or Sekiro, but it has some boss fights that are challenging even to a veteran of the genre. Don't come into this game expecting to overcome anything like you do in Sekiro, but expect to be pushed harder than your average action game. I have not explored a lot of the side content yet, but the few optional bosses I encountered were the hardest fights in the game. I saw some people complaining about the final boss being too hard, but I thought it was easily the game's best fight and is the perfect difficulty level.Graphics are not very important to me when it comes to how much I like a game, so all I'll say about Wukong's graphics is that they are among the best I've ever seen. Not enough to affect my opinion on the gameplay, but very good and is surprisingly well optimized considering that this is the studio's first AAA game. I was even able to get it running fairly well on steam deck, but I would not really recommend playing it on there if you are wanting to play at 60fps or graphics are important to you. Only bringing that up to say how well the devs did at optimizing the game especially considering it's in Unreal 5.",Recommended,1820,52.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4201,"I want to give a fair assessment, but I don't know if I can. Wukong is the perfect mixture of everything a game can do right AND wrong, from the 30 or so hours I've played. Let's talk about the good first:- It's beautiful; drop dead gorgeous- The mechanics are fluid, and the fighting CAN BE pretty dang fun- The characters are well-fleshed out, and the lore is based in real poetry and novel from over 1000 years ago in China- The sense of scale it provides is provided by the larger than life enemies and locations, and not mere map size- And lastly, it's a colorful and bright game, which is a breath of fresh air for the genreNow for the reason I wanted to make this post in the first place; to warn would-be buyers. These are Wukong's negatives:- The fighting gets convoluted real quick. I'm not saying it's hard, but it's technical to the point where it's cumbersome.- INVISIBLE WALLS EVERYWHERE!!! They use invisible walls so often, that it's honestly frustrating. I've never seen a souls-like game make such prolific use of PS2 era boundaries, and it feels amateurish.- It's a step backwards from Sekiro/Elden Ring and it's contemporaries. No new features are showcased. Moreover, the leveling system feels WORSE than its counterparts with no real charm or attention to detail.- And I can't finish this negative segment off without saying that the skills you learn along the way simply aren't fun to use in most cases. You don't feel a sense of vertical growth, but more like a horizontal growth, which feels a lot like not growing at all.These are just the opinions of a critical dude, though. A lot of people love this game, and I can understand why: It's filled with magical, mythical, ancient Chinese adventure and offers a VERY close facsimile to it's more successful counterparts in terms of battle and story-telling. If anybody were to ask me to score it, I would give it an 7/10 on a good day, and a 6/10 on a bad day. Absolutely a solid game -- with some major flaws that made me put the game down after 30 hours. I will eventually beat it, and I hope that it will surprise me and make me change my review.",Recommended,1741,11.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4208,"Aqua-crew mandatory review for us fans of Minato Aqua (who loves speed running difficult games like this). 11 hours in at Chapter 3 at the time of review.240hz OLED, 4080 Super FE, 5800X3D, 32GB 3200MHz RAM. It's VRR flicker fest because of how jumpy the FPS is in this game (which loves to jump from 90-170 fps in less demanding scenes) but it doesn't bother me in the slightest so YMMV if you do own an OLED panel and plan on buying this game.All undervolted 2625mhz/.910mv for GPU. -30 Curve optimizer and default PPT, EDC, TDC for 5800X3D. Tuned to hit max effective clocks. 97-99% GPU usage on 1440p with tweaked settings (see 2 paragraphs below for settings used).GPU peaked at 220 watts while averaging 190-ish to 200 watts. CPU stayed at 65 watts, during shader compilation will peak at around 100 watts.The performance...? Leaves a lot to be desired. It does run good, and it better run good because RT will decimate your frames in boss fights. Effects are sparkly (sadly no HDR support in-game to really make the visuals pop even more even if UE5 supports HDR? Citation needed.)I used HUB Quality RT settings with RT maxed (game looks substantially flat without RT), had shadows, global illumination, and hair set to High. Runs a good 90-130 fps in a lot of scenes. Will drop to 70 fps in more complex scenes. Boss fights with a lot of effects, fire, lightning, water will slash that fps in half, mostly feels like stutter. I just wish it runs better with future optimizations, but for now, even a $2500-$3000 PC with bells and whistles maxed, you will regularly see frame drops below 60 during boss fights even with DLSS and FG on. Bosses with a lot of effects will feel bad, really bad. In times where you need to dodge properly, the heavy effects will throw your dodge game off balance.Sharpening looks bad, you need a mod to reduce it, but why not add it in-game for those who doesn't want to bother having to tweak game files just to make the game a lot more palatable during cutscenes? It's like watching a movie shot on an Iphone with all the depth of field being faked. DOF doesn't feel natural added with the aggressive sharpening filter that they have. It breaks immersion.Game looks good, the style, presentation, story, all of that goodness. Bosses are both amazing when it clicks, and dog-water when it doesn't (BS tracking, charged heavy attacks missing because the AI managed to shimmy a literal pixel away from the actual hitbox of my staff, input lag due to heavy post-processing effects like dust, snow, water, traversal stutter). When the game runs flawlessly, it's like Sekiro/ER levels of flow-state game play. When the dreaded traversal stutter of the Unreal Engine happens during a boss fight, suddenly you get smacked and not have a good time because the game just decides to stream in assets that aren't even in the FOV.The difficulty of the game offsets it with an interesting story of retracing Sun Wukong's steps (based on how I understand the current story at Chapter 3). Kind of like starting from scratch then getting stronger as you go, but not too strong that you break certain rules of the game (Think Elden Ring with heavy R2 builds).You are given the tools, and the freedom to play how you like (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima with your rigid controls and clunky parry/dodge timings). Want to farm before a boss? Go for it though it may be a little slow. Outsmart the boss with different abilities? Go for it. Do it raw hit-and-dodge punish style? The game allows that too and that's how I play it because I want to mostly only *focus on the combat while only treating the abilities given to me as tools to help* me fight a boss and not be completely dependent on using abilities like Immobilize and Rock Solid in every fight.Despite the game's glaring issues such as poor performance even in top-end systems, the some-what doo-doo tracking of some bosses, aggressive sharpening filter. There's just this charm that makes me keep coming back to it just like Sekiro, and ER did for me.",Recommended,3323,32.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

The visuals, the story, the combat, the music, the secrets, everything about this game screams a top tier triple A game in my opinion. Sure the game isn't perfect, with easy to miss items, and no guide, but this to me is a breath of fresh air because everyone's playthrough will most likely be different which creates a diverse player experience. This game is one of those rare few that are a must play on any platform.

4229,"Sadly I have to give this game a negative review. After just finishing it in about 40 hours and doing almost everything there is, the game left me disappointed in what I felt was underwhelming ending to an okay-ish story.Nobody can deny that Black Myth: Wukong is a piece of art in of itself and that lots of love was given to it. I was especially blown away by the artworks between chapters aswell as the animated stories that introduce each chapter.Whilst I was never bored I definitely kept hoping that the game would come around and really pick up the game.First and foremost I had different expectations from what I had seen online. I was thinking that this game was a soulslike game that was difficult to get into and hard to master. Whilst there are some elements of a soulslike this is not a game I would personally put in that category. This is an adventure that is way to easy most of the time. I streamed the whole game to a friend and we both agreed that most of the enemies were too easy to see through and that their health pool was freakishly low. If you die in this game (which will not happen that often) you don't get that aspiration to become better, you just think that the next try will become better. It is, or at least it is in my opinion, not necessary to learn the moveset of the bosses since bruteforcing your way to the game is just too easy.Pick this up at a huge discount or just leave it be.",Not Recommended,1153,44.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 8

4233,"Astonishing game, it surprised me on many levels, I wasn't expecting it to hit me so hard, since I only heard about it about it an year ago while it was still in development.For starters, the game throws you into the POST story of Wukong's lore.[Pre-Game Context]Long story short, Wukong's lore is divided between:-his birth and how he learned to transform into many forms;-how he acquired his staff (Jingubang) after stealing it from under the seas;-how he became immortal and ascended to heavens, causing a big stir and inciting envy from the gods;-how he was expelled from the heavens, incited by Erlang Shen (the Jade Emperor's nephew) after causing a big ruckus in a party hosted by them after he was shunned and taken as inferior to them-how he beat every god and then Jade Emperor (the leading deity on chinese pantheon) requested help from THE Buddha-how he tried to outsmart the Buddha and was punished for it, spending 500 years imprisoned-how he was assigned to accompany and be the bodyguard of the monk Tang Sanzang, along with another important characters that also seek redemption, (the man turned pig Zhu Baije) and use this opportunity to redeem himself and finally achieve Buddhahood.Lore wise that is the summary of it all. I'd recommend watching The Monkey King (2023 Netflix animation) for the origins, and Monkey King is Back (2015 Prime Video animation) for post-punishment storyThe game then starts after all of this, and you are a predestined monkey which wants to find 6 relics to bring the Monkey King back.A game summary with some spoilers:Gameplay wise, [Black Myth: Wukong] plays as a mix between a hack'n'slash and a soulslike approach.The game is divided in chapters, but you can warp between ""bonfires"" without any problem.There is a NG+, and also there are many many quests (which are missable on the first run).The graphics are superb, peak gaming.And ZERO WOKENESS.Sincerely, a glad surprise, i didn't expect the game to be so so good!

That being said the game incentivises the need to engage in new game+ really well. Never felt the need to go through new game+ in any other game but this one really changed that.

4326,"Catastrophically mid. Inferior to all of it's influences. Doesn't do anything heinously wrong, but doesn't exceed in any way.The thing that annoys me most is it's insistence on being ""not a soulslike"" despite the blatant implementation of numerous highly soulsy mechanics, thus making this game another one of the thousands that don't understand what made those mechanics good, or even work.Having commital, non cancelable attack animations is not compatible with fast, reactive combat, it has the opposite effect, it incentivises cowardice, and makes the snappy jerky animations feel clunky and unresponsive.The skill tree doesn't meaningfully expand on the combat, the stance system is underutilised, the transformations are glorified ""spells"". It's just boring. And so the price is unjustifiable.Elden Ring truly got me spoiled, and this doesn't scratch the DMC or ninja gaiden itch.",Not Recommended,754,10.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

4332,"Having spent some time with Black Myth: Wukong, my feelings are mixed. On one hand, the visuals are absolutely breathtaking. The attention to detail in the environments and character designs is truly stunning, but unfortunately, I found myself having to trade that visual splendor for some significant performance issues.The game suffers from occasional FPS drops, especially during cutscenes, and I encountered audio glitches more than once. These issues aren’t constant, but they were noticeable enough to break immersion, which was frustrating. To add to that, the lip-syncing in cutscenes is quite bad, which detracts from the cinematic experience.However, where Black Myth: Wukong truly shines is in its gameplay. It’s addictive, feeling like a blend of the Soulsborne series and God of War. The combat is fast-paced, challenging, and packed with boss fights—just the way I like it. Personally, I found the difficulty satisfying, even on the easier side for those used to Soulslike games. The map is well-designed, though the focus on boss fights and leveling up does make it feel a bit repetitive over time.In short, while the performance leaves a lot to be desired, Black Myth: Wukong offers a thrilling gameplay experience wrapped in a gorgeous world. If you’re willing to overlook some technical hiccups, there’s a lot of fun to be had here.Rating: 8.8/10",Recommended,1148,3.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

Stunning graphics and the combat is fun, boss fight is not too hard compare to others soul-like game. As an old-school gamer like me, who started playing games in the 90s, the invisible walls don't affect the gaming experience much. The game crashed twice during chpt 2, and the crashes seem to increase in later chapters. Aside from one issue in the chpt 1, where after unlocking the secret place of chp 1, the Wandering Wight disappeared and I had to start a new game , the overall experience was still fascinating. The design of Portraits is excellent, and it’s worth reading through each one. The storyline is great, and while playing, I realized I had forgotten a lot of the stories from Journey to the West. Have ordered a copy of Journey to the West after i finished this game.十分推荐这个游戏。战斗有趣，难度系数不算高，空气墙对于我这种游戏年龄近30年的老玩家来说并不会影响游戏体验。游戏在第二章奔溃两次，之后的章节崩溃的次数越来越多。除了第一章开了隐藏关卡后发现幽魂不见了，只能开新档重来，其他的游戏体验还是很棒的。影神图的设计很好，认真看完每一个内容。游戏剧情很好，玩了才发现原来西游里面很多故事已经忘得七七八八了，让我这个海外华人立马下单买了套西游来重温",Recommended,940,147.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

4409,"Enjoyed this game quite a lot and would recommend, although at times it would really grind my gears. I've played maybe 2 hours of a souls/souls-like game before, and although many say its not similar to those games, I'd say the premise is sorta there in terms of the boss fights. This game I'd say is great as an intro to those sort of games, now I've completed this I will go on to play those games!Some things that really annoyed me at times were:- The combat can at times feel janky; especially the dodging and item using. Sometimes it just wouldn't happen after numerous attempts. Some bosses had really dumb hit boxes or lack thereof.- I think I used the Thrust stance once throughout the whole game, and Pillar was only used once I gained a certain weapon that utilises that stance. If not for that, I'd have used Smash stance solely, the other 2 just didn't appeal too much to bother using them.- Mouth flaps are not synced for dubbed versions, small issue but annoying. And I don't get why the main character has no dialogue whatsoever, even just one or two lines here and there would suffice. Hard to make any connection with the character for this reason.- Some side quests and secrets and the odd main story objectives were just too obscure to complete without having to search a guide online. I really hate having to resort to this ♥♥♥♥, I'm not Sherlock Holmes.- Some bosses are unavailable once you get to certain points in the game, some of these are optional ones you might not come across. I completed the main game and wanted to go back and defeat any bosses I'd missed. Unfortunately this again resorted to online guides for locations, I got to one and there was no boss. I found out later that you had to defeat it before getting to a certain point. Why is this even a thing, it's for a very few number of them throughout the game and there's just no reason for it. I immediately uninstalled at this point because 100% completion was made unattainable.- I'm running a fairly decent rig with a Ryzen 9 5900X & 3080 yet I was getting on average 40-60 FPS with recommended settings. And I've definitely played better looking games in the past with much higher FPS e.g. RDR2. It was playable after making some setting changes and still looked pretty but in some areas I suffered with lower than ideal FPS, poor optimisation I imagine?It's easy to point out the bad things, but I would still recommend this game 100% if you want a linear combat focused game with a multitude of bosses, some with a considerable challenge to overcome!",Recommended,2089,55.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

4460,"Black Myth: Wukong really is a masterpiece.The difficulty is pretty high, one could definitely draw some parallels to soulslike games, even though this game is unique and different enough to be a gem in it's very own niche. Some bosses are really hard or require an unusual approach, but most bosses are fair and well balanced. Enemies in the normal areas are sometimes challenging, but quite easy compared to heavier encounters like Mini-Bosses.Navigating the world can sometimes be frustrating since you have no compass or map. I absolutely recommend using a guide, ideally just before the final boss of a given story act. You really don't want to miss all the secret areas, bosses and items - and there's no way you'll find it yourself without any kind of hint or guide. Having a game with such a flair of mystery and mythology comes at the cost of being cryptic at certain points. But it creates a fantastic atmosphere.The art design is simply phenomenal, just look at the trailers and preview images. Insane.The world is fascinating and very beautifully designed - path's are linear for the most part, but there are more open elements as well. The story can sometimes be cryptic as well, but it's capturing and lovely. There are many mythological (or mythologically inspired) background stories about each enemy and character, which are worth investing the time to read them. Gameplay elements like spirits, spells, transformations, being able to rearrange your skill points at any check point, having herbs for your potions in your garden etc. are great additions and open up a lot of different playstyles and strategies.I finished Wukong after ~75h after a very challenging and epic finale - NG+ will have to wait, but I'll definitely revisit this insanely crafted world.

You do 1 or 2 mistakes, you die, you have to start over and you spawn miles away from the boss and all the mobs respawn as well....Definitely not GOTY. That's a disgrace to goated games like God of War and GTA5... You can say it's a mid game.Graphics: 9/10Story: 10/10Performance: 3/10Guidance: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10-Overall: 6.8/10It has many performance issues it drove me crazy while playing this game.It lagged a lot during fights. I could dodge perfectly and still die on boss mech because of stuttering and delays...It lagged A LOOOOOOOOOT during cutscenes... My pc was literally freezing there, and there was desync on dialogues and pictures which made it look even worse... I couldn't even enjoy the story...it lagged a lot while changing locations.First time, i had to set everything ""Medium to High"" on graphics for a game on my pc, and this game still had some serious performance issues that was insane... If you are not a streamer or a content creator that invested a lot on your pc, definitely not worth spending that much for this game.Yes, it has great game content, and nice story mode with decent gameplay but the game performance is very poorly designed and sometimes you just do infinite circles on the map, because there is literally no guidance from the game itself and you can easily get lost... like a maze...I would suggest to buy it when there is a discount on this game or if you can get it free would be even better.If you don't like games like Dark Souls, don't buy it. Also, if you don't have a very strong pc with great specs, don't buy it... It consumes a lot of ram and gpu.Specs:Windows 11 Pro 64-bitAMD Ryzen 9 3900X4095MB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (MSI)16,0GB Single-Channel DDR4 @ 1064MHz",Not Recommended,1511,22.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

4529,"Just to counter balance all the reviews that makes this game sound like the new grail of action games: the game has all the elements to be great, but it's a 6/10 for me.- Combat is very repetitive. You will see the same combo from the beginning to the end.- Stances (the main mechanic to change your combo) barely add anything, with the basic one being disproportionately superior.Chapter 3 has some of the most awful enemy and level design. I stopped the game at that point as there was no longer any fun playing. And I am extremely easy to please when it comes to action games.A large number of enemies at that point are long range fighters... in a game where you don't really have any long range attack/movement (except some abilities that you can only use a limited number of times). It's just downright frustrating to play against, and not even satisfying once you beat them.Really sad this was not the game I had hoped it would be.",Not Recommended,768,24.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 7

4588,"It's a good game that I enjoyed, though it isn't perfect. I went into this with high expectations. I think it's easiest to break the game down into categories:- Soundtrack: It was great. Nothing else to be said, it was good.- Graphics: The game looks amazing.- Story: I haven't read the Journey to the West (though I get the gist of it), but I had no idea who most people were. Still, a lot of characters were pretty cool.- Combat: This is a tough one. The combat feels great, fluid and was fun, but it got stale at some point because it felt like I had just been using the same moves over and over. I don't expect the game to keep giving me new moves (which to be fair, you can unlock more in different stances), but those moves didn't feel like they were much better or useful in other scenarios than the default stance, and even by the end of the game you don't have nearly enough sparks (skill points) to try out more. Yeah, I can reset my sparks for free (which is good!), and try more, but I have to settle for something at some point while I'd like to use more of them without having to lose sparks in another skill. I ended up using my sparks for the default stance and then went for the stat boosts. Magic is fun to use but why is there no way to gain mana (unless I missed it?) back unless you rest? Spirits are cool in idea but I got one I liked early on and ignored the other I got throughout the game because there was no reason to bother with them.- Length/Chapters/the world: The game is made up of six chapters. It took me around 30 hours to beat, though you may take less or more time depending on your skill. I think this is a weakness of the game though. The game is too long for the variety it offers. Chapters three and four were rough for me, I didn't enjoy them, especially chapter three because it turned the game into a kind of open world game but navigation wasn't fun without a map and everything looking same-ish with it being a snow map. Chapter three felt like a chore at some point. I was bored of the map, the same few enemies that kept repeating, the combat being same-ish and the game felt like it was dragging on. Thankfully chapter four was better and chapter five was great again and I started enjoying the game a lot more again, but as I said, if the game was shorter those two chapters would not have felt like they were dragging on as much.",Recommended,1922,36.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 6
4589,"GameplayThe gameplay is in some ways inspired by Soulslike games, you have to rely on Dodging and Parrying enemies if you want to survive. In your path you will find Checkpoints similar to Bonfires and when you die you will respawn there. You also gain souls from enemies you defeat which is both your Experience and Currency.Although I would say this is one of the most Casual/Easier soulslike games. So if you've ever been frustrated with Elden Ring or Dark Souls being too hard or using cheesy tactics to kill you, give this game a try.There aren't any convoluted Attributes for you to upgrade, there aren't any classes.The only thing you can upgrade is your base Stats like HP, Mana, Stamina, Defense and Attack... while also finding items which will boost your secondary Stats like Crit and Resistance.You also have Skill points to spend on a few different skills and upgrades for those skills. And don't worry about farming enemies, if you explore the game and don't rush bosses you will have plenty of skillpoints to spend.The game also allows you to change your gear and build at every Shrine (bonfire), so you can easily mix-match and test different upgrades as you like. So Don't hoard points.There's also a small variety of weapons, each one with 1-3 basic stats like Attack and Crit + some bonus effects unique to that weapon. There's also plenty of armor pieces with similar Defense stats and some bonus effects, Full armor Sets will give you extra bonuses too.There's also plenty of side-quests in the game, NPCs you will meet on your path. BUT these side quests can be missed, there is no indication of there being a quest, there is no journal, there is no tracking, nothing.It's the one thing I HATE about soulslike games, you can very easily pass an interesting and sometimes vital quest just because you didn't annoy an NPC enough or you passed by them.The game starts off difficult, so much like other soulslike games you will have to learn how to dodge, parry and perfect those two. The game offers a tutorial and Demo video for every skill, however there are a lot of things the game Fails to tell you.For example, the game doesn't tell you:* There are many different Combos. Combos can be executed by switching from light attack to heavy or heavy to light attack.* using a Combo during an enemy attack is a Parry. A failed parry will make your staff glow White, a successful parry will make your staff glow Red. Parries block all damage and give you a damage buff.* ALL enemies have item drops, some are basic currency, others useful items like Curios. But the drop chances are very low.* Using spirit form resets all your buffs and debuffs.* You can still do everything without Stamina, but your stats are nerfed by half.The game also has a very well crafted and interesting story. If you're into Chinese Mythos you will be familiar with most of the story, however they put their own twist on it. There's a lot of well made cutscenes and even some Animated cartoons / musicals.The game has 2 Endings in total. The first one is pretty basic, you just have to beat the game. The second ""True"" ending requires you to do many sidequests and beat secret bosses in every chapter of the game. I recommend you follow a guide because like I said, you can very easily miss quests in this game.The game's graphics are pretty standard for 2024. It uses Unreal Engine 5 and it utilizes most of it's tools.It can look great on High-End PCs, however lower-end PCs or even Mid-range PCs will be struggling to achieve the same Good looks.So if you're playing on a 1080p monitor, you will see a lot of ghosting and pixelization. In fact it's some of the worst ghosting I've seen in the past five years.The only way to fix the game's annoying graphical glitches on low-medium PCs, is to use Nvidia's DSR feature and upscale the game to 1440p or Above. But unless you have a decent RTX card... well keep a fire extinguisher nearby.Overall it's a fun game, fun even for more casual players that don't like soulslike games. I do recommend you try it and play it past the first chapter, that's when things get interesting. It has some flaws here and there, some worse than others, but they're more an inconvenience than game breaking.",Recommended,3486,49.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

I pretty much went in blind, not really knowing a lot about it, and after 49 hours I just completed my first playthrough without looking up anything outside of the game itself, experiencing and learning everything for and by myself.This game now easily became my personal game of the year. It plays so well, it looks so gorgeous, it's super fun, feels so good to play, rewarding if you're willing to learn, the exploration aspect of the game almost every time is rewarded with things which actually help you on your journey and it's a pretty long game, but it doesn't feel like a slog at any point.It took me literally four hours of dying and learing just to beat the second phase of the final main-story boss, but as there is no punishment for dying and respecs are free there is no reason to give up. You can also always go back and maybe find some optional content you didn't complete before and get new helpful items or just gain some XP.As I said - for me the game came out of nothing yet is my personal game of the year and I'm glad that I played it.",Recommended,885,56.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

The amount of lore and text that you get from the item descriptions and the entries in the journal can probably be a small book on it's own. From start to finish - the game gives you a fantastic sense of progression without being overly punishing. The combat feels nice and fluid, and has a supremely satisfying feel when it clicks - though it does feel limited until you get some of the stances. The upgrade system for both the weapons, armor, and skills has a very clear progression while still giving you a decent amount of room to figure it out for yourself. The decision to allow you to respec almost anything in the skill tree and stat boost system is extremely forgiving for someone and at least in my playthrough, was essential for getting through some of the tougher fights. The levels have a decently clear through-line but have a good amount of side areas that feel rewarding to explore, whether that's with extra currency or items that help you along the way. The boss fights are very fun and give me that feeling of playing Ninja Gaiden once upon a time as a kid and when you get that final hit - it's extremely gratifying.I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game - it's a fantastic breakout success for Game Science and I hope they have more games in the future that are of this same quality and care.",Recommended,1234,61.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

Cool action RPG, I'm not a fan of souls-like games but enjoyed Wukong a a lot more than I expected.Captivating story for every character in the game, including each smallest random enemies you can find.A little bit of grinding exists since you might need to practice rolling for a little bit and learning the move patterns for each boss. If you want to 100% collect everything you'll need to grind in new game+, twice. If you want to play as Wukong himself you need to clear the game the fourth time.BUGS: Starting on Chapter 3, bugs were becoming more and more common. With a higher end pc with gtx 4090, NVMe SSD with more than enough storage, 32gs of RAM etc., I did not expect so many glitches, freezes, and stuttering to happen. At 4k it remained at a healthy 130 to 150 FPS most of the time, so why is there weird pauses when I call out my wandering wight to do a headbutt on the ground? Cutscenes of just panning camera on the snowy mountain caused it to freeze for whole seconds every other second made no sense to me as well. Those problem remains even when I cap it at 60FPS. Sometimes voice acting is ahead of what's actually going on, and sometimes whole sentences were muted which left me completely in the dark. One time I encountered a slowmo bug, which slowed everything by 300%, which is cinematic and all, but it ruined that fight and I had to start over by restarting the game. I was strong enough to walk over that boss tho so I'm not mad. Just saying this bug exists.Starting from chapter 5, the game feels rushed for release. The final mapGraphics: 10/10Story: 9/10 (I've only reached the 4th chapter and it's 10/10 so far. ) Edit: Fifth and Sixth feels rushed and needs polishing, but I enjoyed the story nonetheless. A weird scene in the true ending animation feels weird tho as Wukong was dating a white dressed lady. Feels completely out of character and non-introduced in any main stream stories. Even in the famous Stephen Chou movie Wukong dated the Bone Guai as a human incarnation. Let me just say I was flabbergasted.Game play: 8.5/10. A good balance between hard fought battles and cinematic rewards.Difficulty: 7/10. The tricks and magic are both fun and helpful. Have lots of fun with them!Music: 10/10Overall: 10/10Needs bug fixes, but this game is more than enough for me to enjoy at the moment.",Recommended,2049,95.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

4659,"I think this game is a 6/10 on a bad day and a 7/10 on a good one. The game looks great visually and ran smooth for me. I maybe had one instance of crashing or freezing, but the performance was up there. There was some stuttering toward the final boss due to all the extra particles. However the game may look TOO good because it is riddled with invisible walls and dead ends that lead to nothing but a waste of time. The combat is fair, you can not button mash your way to victory. It can't be compared to a souls-like game so expect a completely different play style to approach enemies and bosses. Once you get used to that throw it out of the window whenever you face a new boss. The game gives you access to cool abilities and they work on weaker enemies fine, but the bosses adhere to their own agenda and will ignore all sense of the game. For all the stories I've heard about Wukong and how incredibly powerful he is, I never felt unstoppable during any boss fight. If you are up for challenging fights and interested in the lore of Wukong I think it is right for that, but difficulty of this game is not for casual players.",Recommended,915,47.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

4692,"# Black Myth: Wukong as the Pinnacle of Single-Player GamingIn the ever-evolving landscape of video games, few titles have generated as much excitement and anticipation as *Black Myth: Wukong*. Developed by the Chinese studio Game Science, this action RPG draws inspiration from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West* and introduces players to the legendary character of the Monkey King, Sun Wukong. While the game is still in development, its early trailers and gameplay reveals have showcased stunning visuals, deep lore, and innovative mechanics that position it as a potential landmark in single-player gaming. This essay will explore why *Black Myth: Wukong* may be considered the best single-player game ever made, focusing on its cultural significance, gameplay mechanics, narrative depth, visual artistry, and emotional resonance.## Cultural SignificanceAt the heart of *Black Myth: Wukong* lies a rich cultural heritage that is both unique and universally appealing. The game is based on *Journey to the West*, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. This epic tale has been adapted into countless forms over the centuries, but *Black Myth* promises to offer a fresh perspective that resonates with both Eastern and Western audiences.The importance of cultural representation in gaming cannot be overstated. For too long, the gaming industry has been dominated by Western narratives, often overlooking the rich tapestry of stories that other cultures have to offer. *Black Myth: Wukong* not only showcases the depth of Chinese mythology but also serves as a bridge for players to explore and appreciate a different worldview. The character of Sun Wukong, with his cleverness, bravery, and complexities, represents more than just a hero; he embodies themes of rebellion, loyalty, and the quest for identity. This cultural authenticity adds a layer of depth that is often lacking in many mainstream titles, inviting players to engage with the material on a more profound level.## Gameplay MechanicsOne of the most exciting aspects of *Black Myth: Wukong* is its innovative gameplay mechanics. The game promises a dynamic combat system that combines traditional martial arts with fantastical elements drawn from the Monkey King's powers. Players can expect a fluid and engaging combat experience, featuring a blend of melee attacks, magical abilities, and transformative powers that allow Wukong to shape-shift and manipulate the environment.The early gameplay footage has showcased a combat style that is not only fast-paced and responsive but also encourages strategic thinking. Players will need to adapt to different enemies and situations, utilizing Wukong’s abilities to exploit weaknesses and turn the tide of battle. This level of engagement is essential for a successful single-player experience, as it keeps players invested in the gameplay loop and rewards skillful play.Additionally, the game’s world design promises to be expansive and richly detailed, encouraging exploration and discovery. The diverse environments, from lush forests to treacherous mountains, will not only serve as a backdrop for combat but also as a canvas for storytelling and lore. This approach to world-building can create a sense of immersion that draws players deeper into the narrative, making each discovery feel rewarding and significant.## Narrative Depth*Black Myth: Wukong* is not merely a game about combat; it is also a narrative-driven experience that delves into the themes of destiny, self-discovery, and the nature of power. The story is set in a mythical version of ancient China, where players will accompany Wukong on his journey to challenge gods, demons, and other mythological beings. This narrative arc promises to be rich with conflict, personal growth, and moral dilemmas that resonate with players on a human level.The character of Wukong is central to this narrative depth. As a trickster figure, he embodies both chaos and order, making choices that challenge authority while also grappling with his own identity and purpose. Players will likely encounter moments that force them to reflect on their own values and choices, blurring the lines between heroism and villainy. This complexity elevates the story beyond mere good versus evil, inviting players to engage with the moral ambiguities that define the human experience.Furthermore, the incorporation of folklore and mythology provides a fertile ground for storytelling. The rich tapestry of Chinese myths offers a multitude of characters, each with their own motivations and backstories. This diversity can lead to unexpected twists and turns in the narrative, keeping players engaged and eager to uncover the next chapter of Wukong’s journey.## Visual ArtistryFrom the very first trailers, *Black Myth: Wukong* has captivated audiences with its stunning visuals. The game's art style is a harmonious blend of realism and fantasy, bringing the mythical world to life with vibrant colors, intricate details, and dynamic animations. The design of Wukong himself reflects the character's duality—he is both a playful trickster and a fierce warrior, and the visuals capture this complexity beautifully.The environments in *Black Myth: Wukong* are equally impressive. Each locale is meticulously crafted, drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese landscapes while infusing them with fantastical elements. Players will find themselves traversing breathtaking vistas, from ancient temples to mystical forests, each teeming with life and lore. This attention to detail enhances immersion, allowing players to lose themselves in the world and feel a genuine connection to the environment.Moreover, the game's cinematics promise to elevate storytelling through visual narrative. The integration of cinematic sequences with gameplay will likely enhance emotional engagement, allowing players to witness the unfolding drama of Wukong's journey in a way that is both impactful and memorable.## Emotional ResonanceAt its core, the best single-player games resonate with players on an emotional level, and *Black Myth: Wukong* appears poised to achieve this. The combination of a compelling narrative, richly developed characters, and immersive world-building creates an emotional landscape that invites players to invest themselves in the journey.Players will likely form a bond with Wukong as they navigate his trials and tribulations. The character's growth, struggles, and triumphs can evoke a wide range of emotions, from joy to sorrow, and everything in between. Moments of vulnerability and introspection will allow players to connect with Wukong not just as a character, but as a reflection of their own experiences and challenges.Furthermore, the game’s exploration of themes such as friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice can resonate deeply with players. These universal themes, coupled with the specific cultural context of the narrative, create a multifaceted emotional experience that transcends geographical boundaries. Players will not only engage with Wukong's story but may also find themselves reflecting on their own lives and relationships.## ConclusionWhile *Black Myth: Wukong* is still in development, its potential to be the best single-player game ever made is evident. The game’s cultural significance, innovative gameplay mechanics, narrative depth, visual artistry, and emotional resonance combine to create a uniquely compelling experience. By drawing from the rich tapestry of Chinese mythology and weaving it into a modern gaming framework, *Black Myth: Wukong* stands poised to redefine single-player gaming and set a new standard for storytelling and engagement in the medium.As players eagerly await its release, *Black Myth: Wukong* represents a promise—a promise of a game that not only entertains but also educates, inspires, and resonates. In a world where gaming often serves as a means of escapism, *Black Myth: Wukong* of",Recommended,6772,44.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

4716,"So far, this has been dark souls, but just bosses and you do not lose progression.For the souls-nut: It's like god of war, seemingly less story, but much deeper lore (it's kinda crazy how deep it goes). Very enjoyable overall, quite the breeze in boss rush. Original designs. Great soundtrack, awesome cutscenes, fluid gameplay, great combat system and runs smoothly (most of the time).For the filthy casual (like me): People who tell you this is like god of war; they're liars who're just good at souls games, got much better at them and then think this game is ez. Don't trust them. This game goes hard af. Fair, but difficult like holy bananas wtf (♥♥♥♥ you, white clad noble).I will say, no matter what your experience in this game is, everyone will run into a boss (cause there are SO many) they find difficult. Then you'll get frustrated fighting them, but no matter the boss, you'll be sad when it's over and you can't fight them again. Every boss fight is SO different, definitely a love letter to souls-games.

And I still have no clue how staggering or heavy attack tracking work in this game. It's just all over the place.2.

4759,"I'd like to start this by saying it's extremely rare for me to write a negative review for a game, because I accept that it might just not be my type; but I have to address the other reviews here and add some sort of balance:Bought this game because of all the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews. Well, lesson learned: Steam reviews are a joke. Either everyone has collective amnesia, or bots are padding those numbers because, let me tell you, Black Myth: Wukong is absolute trash—technical disaster and storytelling failure wrapped in shiny graphics.Technical Issues Galore: For a game hyped up to be a ""next-level experience,"" Black Myth: Wukong has more bugs than a swamp in summer. There are consistent reports of serious performance issues on PC despite multiple patches. We're talking random crashes, frame rate stutters, shader loading issues, and a bug preventing players from even achieving 100% completion until a recent patch tried to fix it. So much for ""polished,"" huh?Combat Feels Like a Bad FlashbackThey talk up the combat as if it’s some revolutionary experience, but honestly, it's as stale as combat from a 20-year-old action RPG. They slap on some flashy effects to distract you, but once that novelty wears off, you’re left mashing a few buttons, cycling the same boring abilities with zero real strategy. I didn’t expect much from a studio making its first major game, but it’s baffling to me that this somehow gets praise while other titles from bigger studios get roasted for far less.Story—If You Can Even Call It ThatNow, let’s talk about the story, or lack thereof. If you like your narratives to be random encounters strung together with no rhyme or reason, congratulations, this is the game for you. They expect you to be familiar with ""Journey to the West"" and fill in the gaps for yourself because the story provides zero help. No context, no character depth, just cutscenes trying hard to be ""epic"" while the plot makes as much sense as a fever dream. There are no stakes, no emotional connection to Wukong or any character for that matter. It’s just an incoherent mess of scenes thrown together.You know how some games pull you in, make you care about the protagonist’s journey, and make every fight feel like it matters? Yeah, Black Myth: Wukong skipped that memo entirely. Instead, I’m here slogging through what feels like an AI-generated sequence of events without any emotional weight. It’s all spectacle and zero substance.No, wait, I literally made the comment to my mate sitting with me that they should have just run the entire dialogue through GPT 4o and gone with whatever the hell came out. AI would do much better, this game demonstrates the failure of humanity.""Beautiful Graphics"" Are a Cover-UpPeople keep mentioning how ""beautiful"" this game looks. Yeah, graphics are fine, but I’m not spending $100 for a glorified screensaver. It’s like the developers decided, ""Hey, if we make the visuals really nice, maybe people won’t notice that the rest of the game is hollow."" Visuals are about the only thing it has going for it, but even those are bogged down by all the performance issues—frame drops, and stuttering when loading shaders. I shouldn't need a beast of a GPU just to get a playable frame rate. I'm lucky to have an RTX 4090, but most people aren't. I can only imagine how poorly this runs on regular rigs.Refunding and Moving OnI fell for the hype, but I won't fall twice. Overwhelmingly positive reviews, my ass. This game is getting refunded, and I hope others aren't fooled into thinking ""pretty graphics"" equals a good game. There's no heart here, just wasted potential and technical issues that feel like a slap in the face to players who expected something actually worth playing.Bottom Line: An Overhyped, Half-Baked MessYou know what's funny? We, as a gaming community, collectively shredded AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077 when it had issues. But Black Myth: Wukong? For some reason, people are willing to turn a blind eye, as if the studio deserves a pass for launching a game that barely functions right for many. Guess what, they don’t. This isn’t some indie darling struggling against all odds; they had the resources to make something decent, and instead delivered a glorified tech demo wrapped in pseudo-philosophical nonsense.The sad truth is, Black Myth: Wukong is nothing more than style over substance, wrapped up with a shiny bow to trick people into thinking it's something special. It’s all flash and no fire. And you know what? Maybe that works for some people who are easily fooled by pretty particle effects and fancy lighting, but if you value actual gameplay, a cohesive narrative, or anything resembling a finished product, steer clear.I was tempted to tough it out, to see if the game might have a redeeming arc, some hidden depth. But no. Every minute I played felt like another wasted opportunity by the developers to give this game a soul. No, thank you. I’m done.Refunding. Moving on. And I won’t be looking back. If you’re still on the fence, let me be clear—don’t fall for the hype.",Not Recommended,4217,0.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

4769,"MAY HAVE SPOILERS!I came into BM:W without any knowledge on Journey to the West. Playing this game has gotten me genuinely interested in Chinese Mythology and I have taken the time to watch videos on the topic and Chinese natives reactions and insight on how Wukong portrays the classic myth.The gameplay of BM:W reminds me, of course, of the souls games, but that is mainly from the bosses and the dodging (Which are basic descripters of a souls-like, this game has way more to offer than that.) More so, it has elements that remind me of Ghost of Tsushima and the new God of Wars.The combat is insanely fluid, and the tools you are given outside of normal melee are vast and exciting to use. There are dozens of different spirit options that have their own unique equipped effects and moves they perform when you use them. The vessels I find, are very boss dependent, with certain bosses being easier with a certain vessel equipped. The addition of transformations add a new element to combat where you can transform into a boss you have beaten before and may use their movesets (There are only a few of these, not every boss has a transformation obviously.) The spells in Wukong are very versatile, allowing you to slowdown and sometimes quicken the pace of battle, while also countering enemy attacks and allowing for punishment. I ran with Immobilization, Rock Solid and A Pluck of Many throughout the entire game mostly. These three spells provide so much interplay in combat, having mnay weapons and armor correspond with a specific spell.The bosses in BM:W are exceptional except for a few. I'd say 9/10 of the bosses in Wukong are amazing while some could be better or are just bad. None of the bosses felt abhorrent, though.The lore of Journey to the West is exciting and fantastical. The people and creatures met along the way all have their own unique story to them that the game does an amazing job of tying into the gameplay.Overall, I'd say Black Myth: Wukong definitely deserves Game of the Year 2024.

4778,"To date I've played through the game about 3 and a half times running it on a a 4080 Super/Ryzen 7800x3D at 1440p.To keep this as short and as sweet as I can what I can say right out of the gate about Black Myth: Wukong is that Game Science's first foray into the AAA game realm is a home run. It very much feels like a happy marriage between God of War, Dark Souls and a boss rush based on Chinese mythos. It has the action and combat of the latest God of War, an ambiance and challenge akin to what you'd find in Dark Souls, and this incredibly unique architecture in today's day and age of having a linear path going from one zone to the next (and like a Souls game going from one shrine or bonfire to the next) BUT with PLENTY of branches off of that path to explore and discover secrets, new bosses, or entire side quest/questlines.The combat really caught me off guard. First and foremost the meat and potatoes of this game's gameplay are the truckload of bossfights for you to discover, struggle with, and overcome. Your player controlled Destined One (MONKE) uses a staff and a wide array of spells (the latter of which cost mana bar to use). On your first playthrough especially you'll find yourself studying boss tendencies and patterns, trying to discern which spells to use, which to leave at the shrine, what summon to equip, how to properly manage your resources for a multi phase fight. You're given up 3 staff styles with associated skill trees and strengths to play around with mid battle. The combat on paper seems pretty straightforward but I found on my first go around the amount of strategic deduction I was forced to use deepened the combat experience more than I anticipated.There's lots of armor and weapon sets for you to discover and unlock. Later you get the ability to upgrade your armor for enhanced effects (some also change in appearance when you fully upgrade them). Some of these unique armor/weapon combos allow for you play around with really interesting build possibilities like a poison build predicated off of (you guessed it) poisoning yourself for boosted effects and boons or one that increases your damage dealt but also received for a glass cannon run. I found this as a great way of keeping things fresh for me on subsequent New Game Plus playthrough as certain armor and weapons are only available to you in New Game Plus.I came into this game not knowing anything about what the story is predicated on (that being the famous Chinese literature of Journey to the every possible way the prequel to this game) but felt like the plot was accessible enough for me to grasp. Moreover, as an avid Soulsborne player I felt VERY at home with the experience of having a game that's story engages in minimal hand holding with the player. At face value it's easy to understand what's going on but like how Soulsborne players are used to sort of living in the item descriptions to expand their understanding of the lore, in this game as you defeat new mob enemies and bosses you unlock portraits (essentially lore bios) that give you a deeper understanding into who some of these characters are and what they may have done to get to this point. Frankly, the lore and story is about as mysterious something from FromSoft and for some player like me that's a good thing that draws me in all the more. If you HAVE read Journey to the West or are someone that has watched the television show or caught up with the story in detail any other kind of way you are in for a REAL treat as this game is an absolute smattering of fan service, callbacks, and returning characters. Black Myth: Wukong after all is chronologically a sequel to that story so you get the chance to see and engage in that world of Journey to the West and see what's happened since you've last seen your favorite characters. At the end of the day you are one of the millions (and millions) of Destined Ones looking to collect Sun Wukong's relics to hopefully bring him back to the world. To challenge and overcome all the Yaoguai, the kings, the queens. Will you be the right monkey for the job? Can you make this black myth a reality?What to say about the graphics other than it's absolutely stunning to look at. That being said I will point out that I think that clearly this game's strength visually and by design is how pristine the lighting effects are at making everything look so realistic. When really microscoping the textures themselves you see that they're not exactly in a class of their own but the lighting takes everything your eye sees to the next level.I was a little less impressed with the English dub and I'm typically a dub guy. Have played the game in both Chinese and English and the acting portrayals and interpretation of characters feel so vastly different to me. That's usually all well and good (hooray for variety) but the felt like even though English is my first language, the feel of Chinese voice acting w/ subtitles felt more nuanced and layered. Personally I felt like a lot of characters in English dub came off as a bit more one note but I suppose that's preference.To briefly talk about PC performance and graphics settings...my first playthrough was done using Digital Foundry's high end optimized settings with Very High Full Path Tracing. Second playthrough I max'd everything out at Cinematic but no RTX/Path Tracing at all. Third playthrough I opted for every setting on Very HIgh with Very High Path Tracing again. My current playthrough which I am a little over halfway finished with is being done at Cinematic preset with Low Path Tracing. My immediate thoughts on running all of these settings is this: the game is pretty well optimized and mostly runs great. The only thing I will nitpick is that path tracing to various degrees on my setup seemed to induce a little stuttering from my experience. Meanwhile, when i played the game max'd out at Cinematic settings with no PT the game ran like BUTTERY smooth with no stutter that I can recall from start to finish. So my recommendation ultimately from my experience is to either run this game at DF's optimized settings with Full PT if you want the PT experience OR max'd out cinematic with PT off. PT in this game looks good but I would argue the visual difference between Full Path Tracing and simply leaving it off, allowing for the Unreal Engine 5's Lumen technology to take over is so marginal to my eye versus the performance hit it may overall be the better choice to play with no PT as Lumen does such an incredible job of recreating RT effects on a fraction of the performance cost. But try it out yourself see what you like. Regarding FPS on my setup, I was getting anywhere from 90-120 FPS (I did hard cap at 120 so I probably could be getting more) depending on settings and area. With PT on I saw rare FPS drops particularly during certain cut scenes that would bring me down to 60-80 which was fine but didn't encounter that at all on my Cinematic no PT run.Conclusively, Black Myth Wukong is my 2024 game of the year. It hearkens to time when games were made with fun and art being the primary goal. Take a dash of Dark Souls, a dash of God of War, and stir into a pot of Chinese mythological boss rush (again, less of a traditional boss rush as the game is less so linear than ""branching linear"") and you've got Black Myth. 10/10 experience for me and one of the best action RPG's I've played in years. Sensational graphics, fun combat, flavorful lore and story that makes you want to go out and buy a copy of Journey to the West. A ton of stuff I've left out but off the cuff Black Myth gets two thumbs up from me as an achievement in modern gaming as well as a harbinger of the bright future game development has globally and with Game Science specifically.",Recommended,6367,112.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 6

This isn't as hard as other ""soul's"" games, but still brings the challenges to you to overcome. Let's just say it's like God of War Reboot/Ragnarok but 1.5 to 2x more challenging, but manageable.

4850,"Product received for freeBlack Myth: Wukong is an excellent game that challenges what you know about the souls-like genre. It is a VERY challenging game, but it respects your time. To me, it serves as a love letter to gamers who just want a cool hack n slash boss rush type game, NO microtransactions, NO battlepass, just pure fun.Pros:- Story is good (albeit hard to understand without research)- Majority of bosses are really well designed- All the characters were likeable/portrayed very well- Combat system was amazing- You are rewarded after every little battle with amazing loot- The way respawning works in this game is perfect. sets you right outside where you died most of the time which I loved- This game was LONG, but in a good way, everytime you unlock something it was nice knowing I have hours of gameplay left to utilize and learn all the mechanicsCons- Lack of play-style variety, I'm certain I used the same build/combos 90% of players used- This is my personal critique, but the lack of direction in a game as linear as this was frustrating most of the time, a mini-map or quest log would have been appreciated, turns out my first playthrough I missed a BUNCH of quests with cool rewards, you don't even get the true ending unless you do research which I don't like- Collision in this game was REALLY rough. I found Wukong floating above the ground slightly/ colliding with small things on the ground blocking the players controls (often leading to falling off the map) wasn't too bad but something I keep catching even 3 playthroughs inOverall it was the most fun I've had so far in the 2024 releases, with some polishing and clearer in-game direction for the player, I could have seen myself liking this game more than I did, I still think it was very well done.9/10",Recommended,1475,138.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 5

4859,"Black Myth: Wukong is a mesmerizing action RPG that pushes the boundaries of what a game can achieve visually and technically. Inspired by the iconic Chinese classic Journey to the West, it crafts an immersive world filled with mythological creatures, gods, and breathtaking landscapes. The attention to detail and artistry in this game is nothing short of spectacular, making it a standout among recent titles.Graphics and World Design -The first thing that hits you is the stunning visual design. Every environment feels like a living painting. Whether you're navigating dense forests of Chapter 1, scaling snow-covered cliffs in Chapter 3, the world feels alive and deeply tied to Chinese folklore. Each area is unique, filled with intricate details like swirling fog, the rustling of leaves, and the ancient architecture that reflects the mythical era.Even the creatures you encounter, from fierce demons to ethereal gods, are gorgeously designed with a sense of both awe and terror. The sheer variety in their appearances and attack patterns keeps you constantly engaged and fascinated by what you’ll face next. The visual fidelity of the game, combined with its solid optimisation, ensures a consistently jaw-dropping experience.Combat -The heart of Black Myth: Wukong lies in its combat system. It is fast, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. Whilst not a Souls-like, the combat is fairly simple and utilises a hit and dodge style of game play, However Black Myth Wukong gives you many tools to deepen the combat such as spells or transformations. These allow for the combat to shine as battles often feel cinematic and almost scripted as you dance with bosses. The combat blends quick reflexes with strategic thinking. Transformations also keep the combat fresh. You are given the ability to transform into another creature with a whole new move set and abilities. These transformations are incredibly fun and were amazing to use and were often my saving grace for difficult boss fights. Whilst some people complain that the combat is too simple, I beg to differ as games under the same umbrella such as God of War and Elden Ring also have simple combat, however what allows those games to shine is also applicable here. The bosses.Boss fights, in particular, are a highlight. These encounters are spectacularly designed, with massive, grotesque creatures that require mastery of both Wukong’s abilities and precise timing through learning boss movesets to defeat. Every boss is in an absolutely stunning arena, with equally stunning moves and animations. Every boss feels like a genuine test of skill, not just a battle of stats. I found this game to push me to the brink with some of it's bosses. None of the bosses felt unfairly hard though, through perseverance I overcame each one through practice.Audio and Atmosphere -The atmospheric audio design further enhances the game’s immersive quality. This game is a labor of love to Journey to the west through the beautiful cinematic animations that occur at the end of each chapter. The haunting chants, mystical sound effects, and traditional Chinese instruments in the soundtrack all contribute to the ancient, mythical tone of the game. Whether it’s the INCREDIBLE ost or the captivating cut scenes the audio and visual work ties the experience together beautifully.The Story -Here’s where Black Myth: Wukong becomes a bit more challenging—the narrative. Drawing from Journey to the West, the story is deeply rooted in Chinese mythology and philosophy. While this gives the game a profound and rich cultural backdrop, for those unfamiliar with the source material (like myself as a Westerner), the plot can be a bit vague and difficult to fully understand.The game introduces characters, gods, and creatures that are often tied to Chinese folklore, but there’s little hand-holding when it comes to explaining these deeper cultural references. The result is a sense of wonder mixed with occasional confusion, especially when it comes to understanding the motivations of certain characters or the significance of certain events.However, even if some story beats were hard to follow, the mysterious and cryptic narrative still managed to intrigue me. The overall arc of Sun Wukong’s journey is compelling enough to keep you engaged, and the beautiful cutscenes and world-building elements make it easy to appreciate the story on a more surface level, even if certain details get lost in translation.My only other small gripe was performance. I currently have a Ryzen 7 5700 and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. My game was able to stay at a solid 60-80 FPS in most areas at low-medium settings. For me it wasn't an issue as this game is drop dead gorgeous even on lower settings. However in some areas of the game the performance was noticeably worse, such as in chapter 6 where my frames would drop to 30 in some areas. Again, not a major issue for me, however I can see how this game would struggle on lower end PC's.Final Thoughts -Despite the slightly vague storytelling, Black Myth: Wukong is a masterpiece of game design. Its visuals are some of the best I’ve ever seen, and the combat is endlessly fun and rewarding. Even when I wasn’t entirely sure what was happening in the plot, I couldn’t stop playing, thanks to the sheer beauty of the world and the exciting gameplay.For fans of action RPGs, mythological storytelling, or simply those looking for a game that pushes boundaries, Black Myth: Wukong is an experience you won’t want to miss. The slight confusion in following the story is a minor blemish in an otherwise extraordinary adventure. If you're a souls fan such as myself, I highly suggest picking this game up as some of the later bosses are a challenge to beat. I'm looking at you Erlang.My review: 9.0/10",Recommended,4838,52.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 5

Has some fantastic visuals and boss designs, I also loved the musical scores and the animated stories at the end of each chapter.It's definitely a challenging experience, not quite Dark Souls difficulty for the most part, it's a lot more forgiving as you have the freedom to respec whenever you want for free and you don't lose currency/exp when you die.Aiming for 100% achievements does unfortunately require some grinding though.In terms of performance, my system with a Ryzen 7 5700X, RTX 3070 and 32GB DDR4-3600 held a mostly stable 60+ FPS experience at 1080p with DLAA and DF optimised settings.

4869,"It's a pretty good time, to me Black Myth gameplay is a bit like Devil May Cry or God of War but with a splash of souls-like combat mechanics from games like Lies of P (referring to the importance of stagger timing to cancel enemy combos and the perfect dodge mechanic building focus).You retain your experience on death and can continuously farm for potion materials, if you do get hard stuck on a boss you have every option to power up, re-spec for free and come back with a revised strategy.Exploration is very rewarding if fairly linear, some of the hidden content is surprisingly easy to miss though so definitely keep an eye out for NPC's and sneaky pathways.Story is excellent, lore building is good even if you have no knowledge of the Novel it is inspired by.The bosses do require you to be good at learning attack patterns and dodging some pretty hefty combos but there are always tools to use for each tough fight that can help you alot.All in all a solid, finished game with good polish and performance options.

4878,"A really enjoyable, beautifully stunning game which indulges in historical Chinese themes. Up there in my top 5 games with Elden Ring, it's a linear path / checkpoint / enemies / boss souls like looter feel, without the gruelling tough challenge, just enjoyable, fun and easy to master, with the odd handful of very challenging bosses which kept me on my toes for 4 hrs sometimes on the same boss, but even those tougher fights were enjoyable and gave a real sense of achievement once mastered. I loved the ease of the upgrade tree and only having one weapon (a staff) with different power combo moves, it slowly released the mechanics over the first couple chapters / 15 hrs of play. The game is just stunning, truly it is so beautiful to just walk around and view the handful of contrasting naturalistic biomes, so real on a powerful computer only the mythical characters bought me back to reality I was playing a game, I got completed side tracked looking at scenery sometimes, which I love in a game. I enjoyed the fact it wasn't open world, and linear in ways with looping or dead end branches making exploration fun. They had enjoyable looting throughout which gave upgrades really progressed skill. The bosses are amazing, some of their power moves are just so stunning to watch (a huge ball of plasma electricity from a Buddha, the lightning effects from the dragon like beast on the frozen lake, the blood from the temple tiger being particularly memorable). I was almost upset not to be able to replay them again to show partner or just watch again, but this game once a boss is done it's done. The ""Music Video"" in between chapter cut scene videos were just stunning shorts, one even stop motion animation, I really enjoyed them.Things I disliked were the endless invisible walls to keep you within the play area, the game being so beautifully organic and dense vegetation / topography meant the walls were probably needed, but wasted a lot of time going off to explore a cave which was blocked off by an invisible wall. The game loaded quite slow to every checkpoint, quite frustrating when you just want to get on a beat a boss which just killed you. The last chapter was just bosses, all in an open world, on a totally new transportation mechanism. It was jarringly different to the linear and looting nature previous and I didn't enjoy it as much, being no loot, nothing to explore, just ride around trying to find bosses, which leads me to other dislike not having a map, especially for this level, I really had to use online guides for their maps, else I'd have been there hours wasted boringly scouting open land. There was a tough giant stone boss in last area, the checkpoint was miles away, took couple mins to ride back to each time, could easily have been placed closer. The Deer boss was just annoyingly difficult in it's 2nd phase, couldn't get close. Some secrets were very hard to find, sometimes very convoluted, especially as secrets opened up all in total about a 3rd of the game I'd say which could be missed, and also there were a few bosses needed to be tackled in a specific order else you'd loose ability to fight one of them, really frustratingly meant I missed out on a weapon and armour, but it was true to story and followed the story line given, just no clues (maybe I missed them in cut scenes previous). I'm not a NG+ player, once I've run a game (usually to around 95% completion), just not interested in running it again, but annoyingly this game only gives you enough crafting currency to craft 80% of armour, and upgrade only 50% of it on 1st run, yet gives you ability to loot and find everything else. It's a shame as I'd like to have tried other play styles like tanky builds, but instead stayed with my more enjoyed magic / transformation builds. Music has a bit of a ""midi"" / ""BGM"" feel at times, the orchestral hit / synth brass and string chords especially on openers to bosses felt a bit formulaic and old school in boring ways that other games have really gone to town orchestrating and adding to. The English accents for English audio spoken dialogue were a bit hammy and didn't feel authentic to the rich Chinese theme of the game, I love a northern UK accent, but in this theme it felt jarring, wish I had played it with Chinese spoken word and English subtitles instead.None of that stopped it being one of my favourite games. I'd highly recommend anyone play it, its mostly and enjoyable difficulty most could master and a tip, if you get stuck on some difficult non optional boss fights like I did, Youtube's a great resource for finding very specific builds and move sequences to master and nail, as some bosses really require a very specific play style / armour set / specific series of power moves to beat, and there's so many in here you'll need inspiration.Overall though what can be a complicated genre, this developer has really paired back to be an enjoyably difficulty, easy to pick up mechanisms and upgrades game, you can get stuck into and complete with a good sense of achievement without it feeling repetitive. I did a find all secrets, 95% of loot, all bosses run in 75 enjoyable hours. 10 of those probably re running a handful hard bosses. I feel a 120hr game is a better value for money play time, but this certainly didn't feel like a short or small game with all the effort they went into to produce a visually stunning, thematically precise and densely populated game.",Recommended,4476,77.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 5

4897,"Wukong is a breath of fresh air the gaming community has been yearning for a while. Its fundamentally true to game design principles and its focus on a linear singleplayer experience is executed beautifully. The silent protagonist known as the Destined one, is a monkey of few(or none) words with a demeanour that can be summed up in one word; BADASS.Every chapter is unique and special, following a dedicated theme driven and portrayed by its final boss. The Bull King lore and Yaksha King fight being one of the most memorable moments for me. Every Yaoguai, Chief, King and Character, felt that they had a purpose in the game's lore and this is conveyed really well through the lore entries in the Journal as well as in gameplay with different move sets and personality, thus giving each character a distinct identity. The concept of exploration is different here, as the rewards are mainly intrinsic. Finding meditation spots, or secret areas or even unlocking a new Journal entry felt simple and encouraging. Reigniting Sparks offers control, choice and versatility, letting players explore different play styles at any time in the game and it feels ever so liberating. Combat is effective and smooth, with a fairly wide range of options to choose from. Traversal, especially backtracking felt a bit tedious at times. The invisible trigger volumes in the Level Design broke immersion during some instances.For Game Science's first AAA game, it speaks a lot about what the industry lacks in the current era, and how singleplayer games when done right by sticking to simplicity and fundamentals, will always work.P.S. - ""Isn't life a one-way trip?

4908,Maybe this game is not for me. I have got stuff to do besides sit down and attempt to defeat one for hours on end.I would like to enjoy a game and not stress about it so I am uninstalling it. It's a well developed game without a doubt but the dev's seem to have taken pride in creating a game that is deliberately tough to beat. Maybe 10 years ago I'd have enjoyed it.I don't think gamers would have complained if there was an option to play it on less challenging mode as such.,Not Recommended,384,46.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 5
4909,"after 48 hours of gameplay, completing the game with all bosses defeated, a review is appropriate:Short version: 9.5/10. amazing audio design and voice acting (using Chinese voice actors on initial playthrough), beautiful visuals, amazing combat, and excellent talent tree customization options. The only reason this is not a 10/10 is the lack of a map and the crashing problems. For the life of me, i dont understand why Game Science didnt include one. a Map on those large chapters would have been great, but alas, minor issue.Long Version:Audio: the sound track and the Chinese voice actors were excellent. The passion in the dialogue clearly was evident. The sound track adapted with tunes that were appropriate for the moment, soft melodies for somber moments, the roaring beat of drums in combat. It was great!Visuals: I am running a 4090, taking advantage of Ray Tracing and Cinematic level quality. The visuals are absolutely stunning on these settings. The water movement, the sun rays, the shadows, character/NPC details, all incredible.Combat/talent tree customization: I've consolidated both of these due to their interconnection. If you've played any Dark souls game, combat here feels very similar. The focus is definitely on evading attacks, but spells/tricks open up alternative routes (parries, vanishing, etc.). As you progress in levels, the possibility of different combat styles expands. There are different fighting stances, each with downsides and benefits, as well as spells/tricks that can compensate for gaps in fighting stances. The customization in talent trees really is a shining star here, play styles can significantly adapt depending on your choice/build.Negatives: In an effort to be objective, I'd like to point out some things i did not like. (1) First, the lack of a map was an annoyance to me. I think i understand why the devs opted not to include it, but for large chapters, a map definitely would have made things alot easier with navigation. If the idea was exploration, I wish the Devs would have taken another page from Souls games and made the maps similar there, i.e. maps are dark until you explore any given area. This would have been nice especially in circumstances where you die on a boss, and have to navigate back to the area. (2) Second, i had some crashing issues, particularly with the shader compilation. After downloading a new driver for my GPU, i kept getting obnoxious error messages stating ""not enough memory to render . . . "" paraphrasing somewhat, but I am sure other players ran into this problem. I did manage a workaround, but that took research on the web.Summary: If you've read the classic Chinese Novel, you will certainly appreciate this game even more. It's a faithful adaptation to the classic story, you will definitely understand the lore a bit more with that background. If you've not read the novel, chances are, after a complete playthrough, you will.. or you should! Wukong is an absolute blast, amazing visuals, amazing combat, amazing cutscenes, dialogue, just about damn near everything is amazing.

4925,"Black Myth: Wukong, hence BMW, is not typically the type of game I play. But since it was bundled with my graphics card, I felt compelled to give it a chance. I've now played enough of the game that I feel I can give it an honest unbiased review. BMW is all about boss fights. There is literally over one-hundred bosses, each one harder than the last. It is without a doubt one of the most challenging games I've ever played. You will die... a lot. So if repetition isn't your thing, this game probably isn't for you. But with patience and persistence, you will eventually learn their moves and be able to defeat them. I've found that once I picked up spell binder, things got easier although it comes at an expense of losing other abilities.I'm going to go over a few things I feel BMW could have done better. I don't know whose idea it was not to include an in-game map. I'm sure there was some design decision for it. But whatever the case may be, I feel it was a detriment to the game. It's easy to get lost at times and miss some important parts of the game. It's especially difficult for the completionist gamers who don't want to miss any bosses. The other thing is, there's a few sporadic quests that are import to defeat a particular boss. The problem is, it's not always clear what you must do. A few times I had to look of guides on the internet to figure out what to do. They need to be more intuitive.Overall, the pros far outweigh the few short comings of this game. It's a fairly complex fighting game that is good at what it does. As a result, it will not be for everyone. Not that it's a bad game, but just because it's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you like challenging fighting games, BMW is definitely for you.",Recommended,1406,99.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 5

4928,"The good:Like a hybrid Souls-like game mixed with the story telling and leveling system of the recent God of War titlesThis game has some of the best combat of any souls-like game I've played.The bad:Frequent crashes to the point where the game simply would not launch at all. This was fixed by the first patch. However, performance is still far below where it should be and the game basically crashes almost every time I try to fast travel between shrines. This is especially a problem when traveling between chapters. I can almost guarantee that upon completing a new chapter that the game will crash before I can start the chapter and I will have to restart the game.My specs are RTX 3080/Ryzen 3700x/64GB DDR4 and most games run great in 1440p or 4K. This game can barely manage to run at 60fps without stuttering at 1440p with settings reduced.

I really don't like soulslike games I realised. It feels less stressful than Sekiro but nonetheless being penalised for failed attempts is still very much part of the game. You drink a potion and if you still died, you lost it, that's it, face the boss again but in a worse position. Sometimes you have to run for a long time after dying through identical content just to die again at the very end. But if you like the challenge and facing same boss 20 times, maybe it's for you. I do consider myself pretty good at games having played since I was a kid. Good luck to those who are just starting..

5008,"The short version: Buy it. Buy it now.The long version:Genre: Despite first impressions and what the trailers might suggest, this isn't really a Soulslike- more of a Souls-lite. You have the classic healing flask, bonfire-style checkpoints, and low-presence story, but you don't lose currency on death and rather than increasing stats you improve specific abilities upon level-up. On the whole, the game feels a lot like somebody's taken a Soulslike and mixed it with Dad of Boy, with a result that feels different from both but that's undeniably well executed and enjoyable while being its own unique thing.Level Design: The game is divided up into six chapters, each of which takes place in a different environment with a unique set of enemies. The first chapter is a fairly linear affair, but the second-through-fifth are branching and sprawling tangles filled with side content and extra objects, and the final chapter goes full open world. I feel the game is at its strongest in the linear and branching sections, as you can feel the progression and story advancement much more meaningfully and the scripting means the levels just flow better, but the open world section is still fun- just not quite as fun. All-in-all, the game's structure is very solid.Combat: The base gameplay loop is based around dodging attacks and landing quick light attacks to build up 'focus', which you can then use to land big heavy hits. It's simple and straightforward, but also well-executed and fun. However, as you advance through the game you steadily unlock new staff moves, spells, transformations, and items which give you more options to play around with. It's done at a steady rate which means you're never overwhelmed, without it feeling too stingy or spread out- you essentially have all the base tools for your kit by the game's half-way point, giving you plenty of time to learn and experiment. Enemies, meanwhile, hit hard, fast, and often, but never feel unfair- everything that gets thrown at you is dodgable or interruptable with some practice. A few bosses do have healthbars which feel a little bloated, but those are the exception; in most cases you can see your attacks take satisfying chunks and chips out the life of what you're fighting. In conclusion, the combat is fun, varied, and challenging enough that you won't get complacent or bored with it in a hurry.Progression: The game's progression system pretty closely resembles the Dad of Boy games, with you gaining perks as you level up which you can spend in a range of skill trees to unlock new techniques, enhance your character's stats, improve your spells, and so on. The range of options you have is much greater, however, and some of them turn abilities or spells into absolute gamebreakers (protip: fully upgraded Pluck of Many absolutely deletes enemy healthbars). And best of all, you don't really need to worry about spending points on an ability you end up disliking or not using and screwing yourself over- you can respec your perks for free at any shrine (the game's bonfire equivalent) whenever you like. And on top of that, levelling up's also not the only avenue for improvement you get- starting from the near the end of second chapter you unlock the option to increase your stats in a completely separate way to levelling up, and in the third you unlock the ability to improve your armour sets (a relief for me, as some of the weaker sets had abilities I really liked). Overall, I felt the game's progression system is one of the best I've seen.Difficulty: Most enemies and bosses in the game aren't too difficult, however there are some exceptions. The end-of-chapter bosses all go hard, although if you explore enough you can find items or spells that make them much easier to deal with, and the game's final boss is one of the most difficult and memorable I've seen outside of an actual FromSoft game. I wouldn't say anything quite rises to level of, for example, Malenia from Elden Ring, but it's close. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends entirely on your taste, but I felt it struck a good balance between making the important bosses feel genuinely hard without making them unfair.Story: The game's story isn't a heavy presence, with the game's primary focus being given over to the moment-to-moment gameplay, but it's still easily comprehensible and interesting. I will say that you probably need at least some knowledge of the Journey to the West to get the most out of it, but even without that you should be able to make sense of what's going on. There's nothing truly shocking or groundbreaking about the game's story, but it is delivered very solidly and competently and is enjoyable.Characters: While most characters only have a minimal presence in the story, the NPCs and key bosses are all still full of life and have memorable personalities. I would have preferred to have seen more from quite a few of them, but what's there is still good. And it's at least partially made up for by the game's character profiles- every enemy and NPC in the game has a character profile you can unlock, which tells you a short story about them and gives you a traditional Chinese-styled portrait of them.Graphics and Music: In a word, stunning. The game is absolutely beautiful, enemies and environments are detailed and a true feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack is easily one of the best I've heard from any game. A+++, no question, and even more impressively the effort into this side of things hasn't come at the cost of game length or gameplay quality. I will note that I have a fairly high-end PC, so I was able to run the game at max settings without any problem, but even on a lower graphics setting I still can't see it being anything but incredible.Overall: Easily one of the best games I've ever played. Full stop. Either a 10/10, or so close it makes no practical difference. Heartily recommended.",Recommended,4897,96.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 5
5009,"**Game of the Year 2024**Black Myth: Wukong is a testament to why I love video games in the first place. I am not too keen on the souls-borne genre, but this game gave me both the grinding pains of menacing boss fights, and the dopamine hits for every successful boss defeats with flamboyant skills and diverse move-sets. Seriously games nowadays are pandering or politically inclined with social messaging which, to be honest, as an Indian guy, I couldn't care less. But this game, ah, pure gameplay with intense story-telling designed to be a sequel to the Journey to the West novel. I scoured through YouTube for learning more about the source material after every playthrough. I refunded my God of War: Ragnarok pre-order and bought this game. Trust me, it is worth every single penny. 151 hours in, I'm at New Game ++ and I still can't get enough of this fantastic game.

5018,"I honestly can't believe the reviews for this game are 96% positive because for me it was one of the most over hyped games that came out this year. When I started it was actually pretty cool, the cut scenes were sick and the story was intriguing. However after only two hours of playing the game I instantly got bored of repeatedly just pressing x and going to boss fight after boss fight. The skill tree was terrible and the game wouldn't even give you upgraded gear to fight new bosses or a weapon as the stick is the only weapon you get in the game. For me personally I think fighting a boss should be more of a special occurrence and not something to be fighting every ten minutes like it is in this game. The combat system was also very rigid and the hit boxes were terrible, I would be there just spamming the button to dodge and it would only work 50% of the time. Also the heavy attacks are so poorly optimized with the combat system which led me to use light attacks on bosses who were barely affected. I understand people like games where you just hop from boss to boss for who knows how long but for me this game just wasn't enjoyable.",Not Recommended,928,1.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 5

The game play, although a bit challenging at times, is immersive and really gives a nice adrenaline rush especially on boss battles. Losing and dying multiple times might just be par for the course, as I've never played a souls, soulslike, or soulslite game, but overall the game really makes me glad I built a powerful enough PC to experience this game. Smooth gameplay, interesting progression of enemy types, great visual effects, and amazing characters.I might just buy the DLC sometime later just to support the devs, as I got this game for free.

Even the locations in the game, many are real places in China. What's interesting is, the dark side of Wukong's story is very well written. You can almost never fully understand it unless you watch other commentators who have more knowledge in the original Wukong story, and the philosophy to it. And people who spends time to link up the different points. Also the fact that there are hidden missions and maps that you need to figure it out is pretty cool.Some say the old monkey was the original Wukong, he never died...but had certainly aged given he found out the truth behind what it takes to obtain long-life. And so sad, that the spider girl that waited for him for so long needed to die in the end.

While some may label it as 'another Souls-like,' it does feature the quintessential challenging battles characteristic of the genre, particularly with the bosses.

It takes a concerted effort to advance every step, and at times it can seem a slog. There is no difficulty level to adjust your gameplay experience. Overleveling can only take you so far, due to the implementation of this mechanic. But it's a mountain I am thoroughly enjoying throwing myself against.I find the actual story a little hard to follow at times - it almost seems to assume some understanding of Chinese mythology and customs. But the gameplay has nuance and progression, and the fighting mechanics are sound.

5149,"There are a lot of different viewpoints on this game, so I wanted to toss in my 2 cents to help someone on the fence about buying it.Let's start with the cons:Invisible walls take you out of the immersive experience.FPS drops happen from time to time (I've found switching from your current graphics setting to another and then back usually solves the issue).Random bugs: I had a boss fight or two where the boss just stopped taking damage. Not world-breaking, but frustrating to say the least.*This could be on my ability to make a computer function adequately, but I found that the audio drops when using discord at the same time. Completely randomly too, during cutscenes and gameplay, even in the title menuSome translations can be a little off, or the subtitles don't match what the English VA is saying.You need a pretty hefty rig to run this game smoothly. Mostly smooth on a 4070 64gb.I'm sure there are more things that could be said, but I'm taking this from my 66 hours in game at the time of writing.Pros (with some semi-cons):It feels immersive to me. I cannot say that one might have the same experience, but I felt pulled in by the story. - wanting to know more about the main character, and the relevance of Sun Wukong (at the time of buying the game, I was unfamiliar with Journey to the West).Going in knowing nothing of the story, I felt pulled in, exploring every cave and hole that I could find (tried finger, but hole), and I believe that the game rewards that style of play. If you enjoy taking your time through unmapped areas (because there is no map at any point), then you may enjoy this game.Graphically, the entirety of the game is stunning. I loved everything. Especially the meditation spots.The game is a boss run with a heft of story and some side character/stories sprinkled in. Don't be surprised to find a boss in every other room.As far as difficulty, most of the game felt manageable, with some laughable insults from endgame bosses. Once I hit NG+ I've found little to no difficulty.In original playthrough, there felt like a fairly large difficulty spike between Chapters 5 and 6.You get to be a monke with lots of powers? This was just really cool to me.The combat can be repetitive, if you let it. Changing your skills up and stepping outside the comfort zone of immobilize offers a way for you to develop tyour own unique playstyle. If you're able to progress far enough to have your different stance trees open, changing mid-battle is pretty fun and an effective way to keep out of boredom's grasp. I've really enjoyed the combat, but I can see why others may not.Transitions from cutscenes to fighting was a really fun aspect and something I'm not used to seeing.Ultimately, I loved the game, but I don't think it's for everyone. It's a game that requires exploration and some level and eff around and find out to really find everything and have all the gameplay options available to you. While the graphics are beautiful, the requirements to run the game are big and it comes with a sizable 100gb of storage on your hard drive. There are still bugs, but as of the 9/23 patch the game seems to be running better with the severity of many of the issues I originally experienced dropping drastically.TL;DR If you've got a good gaming setup, like beating up bosses, exploring, and changing up your combat from time to time, and enjoy monke, you'll probably enjoy this game.f you go into it expecting a souls-like with lots of weapon options and hate invisible walls, you're gonna have a bad time.",Recommended,2914,80.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

5172,"Updated after beating the game.first off. i don't understand the hype behind this game. 600k+ positive reviews you would think this was the most well crafted game in recent history. its not.The graphics are amazing. Some of the best I've seen and its well optimized, but my mind was by no means blown by the game play or mechanics. And although there are a few times where I did have a lot of fun, clutching out epic moments in fights, the fighting gets repetitive fast, and the enemies in between bosses serve no other purpose then wasting time, as they provide 0 challenge.This game suffers from being laughably easy 99% of the time, where most combat boils down casting spells to spank bosses.yet the 1% it is challenging. Its challenging because its cheap. cheap cheap cheap. so very cheapThe only challenging bosses (of which so far ive only ran into 2) comes from the fact that the game just does whatever it wants. Braking its own rules to make sure the player dies.What i mean by that is the enemy attacks through objects suddenly when it feels like it. but cant other times, and sometimes they outright ignore hit boxes, and adds moves to its roster to specifically counter perfectly what you are doing, if you are doing too well. I hate it when game devs do this. They cant figure out a way to challenge the player, so they have to make a certain boss unbelievably cheap in order to provide said challenge.I wont list which bosses for the sake of spoilers. But as a nioh, dark souls, and sekrio player, I can confirm that these bosses are very poorly designed. not because of the challenge they pose in learning patterns, pace, timing, and the challenging the limitations of the skill and timing of the player. but because they simply are just cheap. When a boss is attacking so often that you simply don't have time to counter attack, even if you are perfect dodging, and the attacks STILL are coming, and coming and coming and coming ENDLESSLY without PAUSE and you outright die because eventually you cant perfectly dodge 1000 attacks in a row, you know you have an issue.then about the 20th time fighting it. The game goes ""ok you have been punished enough."" and they hit the stupid button. and the fight is suddenly easy again... like... what?If you play this game and are a skilled souls like player, expect to one shot most bosses. and the 2 or 3 bosses that are a challenge. expect cheap tactics to create the illusion of challenge.oh, and by the way. if you do things out of order in certain cases. You will be locked out of certain fights. Meaning you have to beat the game. Go into new game+, play another 30 hours to get back to what fight you missed, and do it in the correct order. If that isn't the mark of poor game design, I don't know what is.Now that I have beaten it. My scoring has gone up a bit. But over all. Wait for a sale if you wanna buy this game. And don't expect anything ground braking. This game has way more hype then deserved.4.5/10",Not Recommended,2434,45.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

5177,"-A FEW WORDS FIRSTThis game is simply amazing! From the graphics, to the gameplay, to the story, to the enemies, everything feels fantastic. Is it difficult? Yes, but nowhere close to souls like. From a point onwards you are becoming really powerful in the game and it doesn't feel that difficult as in the first 2 chapters anymore. So if someone is avoiding it cause of the difficulty you are missing out on a fantastic game worthy of the title ""game"". If all the studios/companies were putting this much art and love towards their games the gaming industry would be a much better world to be involved in. This game isn't about greed like most out there, it's about as simple as it should be, grab a controller and have fun. Bravo to the studio that made this game and am looking forward to their future games for sure! Definitely a must play!(Little note: the game is a lot more like God Of War, not like Dark Souls.

5188,"I want to give this game a sideways thumb, because it is a good game. To be quite frank... the souls and souls like genre isn't my top pick for gaming. It feels like a chore after a day of working. This game is beautiful graphically and the combat and boss designs are very neat. The Lore of Sun Wukong is appealing but the constant having to kill boss after boss when i dont understand why they are trying to kill me out of the blue is tiring for me personally.I respect what the game has to bring for people who specifically like these sorts of game. For me personally i find it a chore... partially because im not the best Souls like player. But ive played Elden ring and rather enjoyed that game but i believe because the world was very rich and explorative. Its not so much with Black Myth Wukong. That's okay,.. just not my cup of tea while it is for others.I dont mind linear games as long as they have a good story and the game play is challenging with some hard elements. Take for an example. I LOVED the 2019 God of War games. They had a great story as well as some pretty tough challenges along the way but overall i felt like everytime I logged on to play God of War i knew I would progress through the story and slay some Valkries in some way. Black Myth wukong is MUCH MUCH more challenging and thus tends to feel like a chore. Once again I will say that I am not a die hard Souls like player and I know other people find a real satisfaction in beating difficult bosses back to back to back and so on... such as in this game and i am truly happy for that for them. But this game was just not for me...So if you are a souls player then get this game... if you are not or are interested in dipping your toes into those waters... just know that you may find Wukong more of a chore than an enjoyable experience like how i did.",Not Recommended,1476,19.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

I used to love Journey to the West when I was in university, but it was never so rich in my imagination, now I went back to reread it, came back to play and loved it all even more. Even brushed up on my Chinese for the occasion. English localisation is good, but it is missing a beat here and there.Lots of people complain about the plot being sketchy, but really - go ahead and pick a random couple of chapters from the book if you don't feel like reading the whole bulk of 100 chapters. If I remember to do it, I will later update the review with chapter numbers where the game bosses appear. The way the story is told, loot description, dialogues - it all follows the pattern of big Chinese novels. Finally something made by Chinese for Chinese, authentic to the bone. Could probably do with more recaps though =DThe combat is satisfyingly challenging (I leave Souls games for people with staighter hands than mine, this is not Souls difficulty).

5219,"2024 Game of the Year, period.Game play: 10/10This game is the true spiritual successor to the beloved Ninja Gaiden series. It masterfully combines the best elements of Ninja Gaiden, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and the new God of War into a gaming experience that is nothing short of phenomenal. It’s safe to say that no other action game comes even close to what this title has to offer.Story: 10/10Once you unlock the true ending and piece together the complete narrative, it will bring tears to your eyes and linger in your thoughts for weeks. However, a basic understanding of the source material—Journey to the West—is essential to fully appreciate the character backstories and the depth and subtlety of the well-crafted dialogue. If possible, play the game in Chinese, as the English dub doesn’t do it full justice.Technical Performance: 8/10I own the game on both PC and PS5 (yes, it is THAT good). It runs smoothly on my gaming laptop (NVIDIA 4070), achieving a consistent 70-90 FPS on ""very high"" graphics settings (with ray tracing turned off). However, the PS5 version experiences noticeable frame rate drops and stuttering, even in performance mode.",Recommended,971,26.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

And there's a good chance, I'll never finish Black Myth: Wukong, like I never finished any other souls game I've tried. Thankfully, it's not exactly as punishing as the actual Souls games.But this game is unironically great at pretty much everything and I regret nothing.Great fun and value for your money, polished, stable, solid framerate, amazing visuals, controls are are reliably responsive, no bugs or glitches encountered, no ""current day"" BS included, no microtransactions (yet), just pure oldschool game without nonsense like, for instance, Stellar Blade did it.Easy 8/9 out of 10 for a filthy casual like me.Solid 10 out of 10 if you like souls-likes or being challenged in general.Deserves ALL the praise it gets. All of it.The only thing I would nitpick is that, sometimes, attacks hit you even though they visually don't look like they should. But that's literally everything I have to say on negatives, without inserting my own bias.One of the easiest recommendations I've ever given.",Recommended,963,8.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

5239,"It's my first time giving review for a game ever. And it's my first time buying a game at full price instead of waiting for a discount and performance improvement. I have to do it because Black Myth Wukong took me on a journey that I couldn't imagine would be possible. It was truly an escape from real life. The scenery, the story, and lore all worked together to embrace me into this fictional world that's drastically different than reality.The combat in this game is clean and flows very well. I didn't encounter any bugs after almost 60 hours of game play and I am just in Chapter 5. So for someone who isn't good at combat games, the average play this doesn't apply. It's more likely to take you more than 80 hours to beat the game. Why? You get stuck on a difficult boss and keep getting beaten up, go respec and try different approaches until you beat the boss. Some of them can take you all day. The act II final boss, the big rat took me the whole night to beat. When it finally beat him, it was 6 AM. The difference between this game and other souls game like Sekiro: when you are defeated by a boss from Sekiro for several hours, you want to give up. Because there is no respec, you feel trapped. But in black myth Wuking, you can respec whenever you want, where ever you want, you feel free to explore other options instead of getting trapped, just like life. It's the mean reason I keep getting motivated to go back to a boss after getting defeated 100 times, I get the freedom to choose what kind of character I want to develop without consequences of sunk costs. I can't say the same for most of the most recent games I've been playing.The build in this game is diverse and give you a lot of room to explore. Yet it's not as complex as Diablo so you don't understand what you are doing. And the good news, you don't have to farm for hours hoping with 1% chance that you will get the drop you want. You get the gear you want by defeating the boss, that's it. The harder the boss, the better the drop.Surely you will encounter invisible walls all the time, but that's the sacrifice the developers need to make to let you experience this great visual world under 130 GB! Their leap of faith this that the great visual experience, combat, story and world building will be enough to get you hooked into this game instead of worrying about invisible walls. And some of the invisible walls are reasonable, would you rather walk 1000 miles, jump of a mountain and die, and spend minutes just to run back to that mountain? I don't think so.The PC requirement isn't that high. I am rocked a computer I build back in 2019, NVIDIA 2070 S graphics card and amd ryzen 5 3600 cpu and I can play this game in high setting without lagging. If you at least have a 2000 series graphics card and experience low fps, turn down visual effect and global illumination, at least you have a fluent game.This game is designed for people who wants a guided direction from beginning to end (think Uncharted 4), engaging story (although it's better you watch a video summarising Journey to the west to know what's going on), not afraid to be defeated and come back and try a different approach. I promise you the dopamine rush from defeating a hard boss hits you like Mike Tyson. Just like life, when you overcome setbacks and finally accomplish your goal, you are in a bliss of joy. If you want a true open world with hundreds of hours of farming, and defeat boss easily once you get the best gears, this game is not for you. In this game, the journey truly is more valuable than the end, which might leave you feeling empty after defeating the game.",Recommended,2960,102.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 4

5269,"When Black Myth: Wukong dropped, I was very skeptical. I grew up as a huge DBZ fan but had no idea that Wukong was a source of inspiration. Honestly, the game looked like another try-hard, wanna-be souls-like that was simply cashing in on an iconic character.Boy, was I wrong.I started seeing gameplay videos flooding youtube and tiktok. While certainly a very similar feeling to the Souls series when it comes to boss fights, it feels very unique and refreshing in its own way. Combat is top notch, the controls are tight, and the the skill tree is both dense and rewarding. While the core gameplay is comprised of mainly bouncing between boss battles with a few (and I mean, very few) enemies, the ""open world"" feels very good to explore. Each time I tuck into a corner or press forward just a little further to see, I'm often rewarded with a hidden chest.There's a robust crafting system, brewing, spells and transformations galore. Respeccing your character is not only free of charge, but encouraged to try new strategies for each boss. I think my favorite part is there's no lost progress upon death. You always maintain your progress, making death feel more like a minor setback than a soul-crushing experience. Pun fully intended. As a mid-30's gamer, I will not get into games that don't respect my time and this one does so beautifully.But while Black Myth Wukong ticks all of these boxes to make a great game, it's story is what truly captivates me. Rarely do I care about the lore behind bosses, but each of these seem to be hand crafted with great detail and I find myself reading their entries after each boss battle. Learning more of their story is almost as good as the loot. It's a strange, perplexing, and difficult journey and I look forward to more beautifully crafted cut scenes after each chapter.There's only one downside to the game that I can really bring up: You have to git gud. There's no running away and overleveling like Elden Ring. There's no ridiculous OP weapons or summons that will hard carry you through encounters. Often times it's just you, the boss, and all of your abilities on cooldown. There are times that some fights seem ridiculous, but I can honestly say it never feels unfair when I die. The game makes you get up close and learn the dance of each boss. Really gets your blood pumping and once you finally down that boss after multiple attempts, the feeling is euphoric. Because YOU did it.So if that's the only negative, then it's one I'll gladly accept. Getting stuck in the Water Temple for weeks made me appreciate that piece of the Triforce. Downing Ruby and Emerald Weapon after weeks of grinding and min-maxing were moments of monumental bliss. I've got a feeling that Black Myth Wukong has a few achievements like this waiting for me at the end, and I'm looking forward to every second of it.Go buy this game. I'll update this review upon completion, but there's a high chance this will be my favorite release this year.UPDATE EDIT:100 hours in and I've completed the game 100%. All 81 achievements. Currently on NG+3 and still loving it, although I've decided to put it down for now. The sheer enjoyment this game has brought me has made it my personal GOTY. I loved it enough to beat it 3 different times and get all the achievemnets and not once did I ever think ""Aw man, I've gotta log in to do X, Y, Z...""Through all the trials and tribulations, I have persevered. And it has been the experience I've needed for a long time.P.S. Screw you Developers.

5339,"Black Myth: Wukong is a stunning action-adventure RPG that brings to life the legendary tale of the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Developed by Game Science, the game has been generating buzz for its breathtaking visuals and intricate gameplay mechanics since its reveal.Graphics and Art Design: The first thing that strikes you about Black Myth: Wukong is its gorgeous graphics. The game utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to create lush environments and meticulously designed character models. From vibrant landscapes to detailed enemy designs, every frame feels like a work of art. The lighting and particle effects enhance the overall atmosphere, making you feel immersed in a fantastical world.Gameplay: Gameplay combines fast-paced combat with strategic elements, allowing players to harness the Monkey King's unique abilities. Players can utilize Wukong's transformation skills, using his iconic staff to engage in dynamic combat against a variety of foes. The fluidity of the combat system feels satisfying, blending melee strikes, magical attacks, and acrobatics seamlessly.Story: The narrative follows Sun Wukong on his journey, exploring themes of identity, power, and rebellion against oppression. While the overarching story aligns with traditional lore, it also introduces fresh elements that deepen the character's motivations.

IDK about the haptic feedback on ps rollers but it is meagre and miles behind games like Days Gone (best haptic feedback in any game) and God of War.- Story can be better explained. I should not have to check yt for every chapter explained.- more types of staff.

5377,"This review is an interesting one for me. I'll jump right in.I'm giving this game a thumbs up and recommending it because the game is a lot of fun, the combat is great, the visuals and sound are amazing. Despite some technical issues they need to iron out that should have been buffed out BEFORE LAUNCH, it's IMO a good game regardless.The interesting part is that I haven't finished it, nor do I plan to. Simply put, the combination of some truly frustration and annoying bosses combined with technical issues like abnormally large hitboxes, I found I was more frustrated than having fun. I'm in this hobby to be happy and have fun, and I realized I was more frequently irritated during some boss fights. I'm fine with a challenge, and Black Myth Wukong brings plenty of that. Some bosses, however, have cheap aspects that I do not enjoy.The reason I'm not giving this a thumbs down is because the quality of the game is undeniably good IMO, and if you're really into boss rush games and souls-likes, this is up your alley. It really is a great game.There is traversal stutter, hitboxes for some bosses in the later chapters are incorrectly sized, and at one point at the introduction to a boss, my framerate went from 70fps to 20, to 40, to below 20 before finally rising back to the mid to high 60s. After dying, I had to wait for the game to stabilize after it reloaded. The framerate/frametime was all over the place before it settled. Fortunately this was infrequent. I made it to the end of chapter 4 (of 6) before I'd had enough. Could I have pushed through and finished it? Absolutely. But the fun factor for me was rapidly diminishing and the fun to frustration ratio began to tip toward the latter.Game Science needs to drop a few more patches for this game to fix the hitboxes and traversal stutter. The absence of a map is something I did not like. I've heard the game opens up a lot more for the final two chapters, and if that's true, I can see this being an annoyance. However, it was the developers' decision and I respect that. Not a deal-breaker.I would have liked more to the game than fighting a hand full of enemies between the next boss, but it's a testament to how fun the game is that this is also not a dealbreaker.All in all, if you enjoy souls games, you should enjoy this. If you can look past ""some"" bosses having really cheap attacks that can send you into an expletive-ridden tirade, you should enjoy this, and I hope you do. It is a good game that is simply not for me to the degree I no longer desire to finish it.If you decide to play this, I hope you enjoy it. There is a lot of good, here.Thanks for reading.",Recommended,2157,43.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

5388,"Finally reviewing this masterpiece.I have completed the default ending, and also the secret/true ending on my first run. Then also did a run on NG+This games progression is one of the best i have ever experienced. From starting with basically nothing besides your default staff, to becoming one of/if not the strongest being in all of mythology. Its f*kin incredible.But you of course have to work HARD for that title. Even though this game is very forgiving in terms of letting you re-spec anytime you want and also not losing your ""will"" every time you die, it is still a challenging game. With many different enemy/boss types, it really keeps you on your toes for what you have coming up next.There are quite a bit of side quests you can do throughout your play through. Ones that can open up secret areas in the game and also lore dialogue (for the true/secret ending). So EXPLORATION IS VERY REWARDING IN THIS GAME.Even though this game is more of a linear story and not an open world behemoth. Each area you are put in is big enough to where you don't get lost while exploring. Yes i know people are complaining about this game not being open world but come on now. Open world games are kind of overplayed IMO. And i am glad this game did not go that route.Visually. This game looks exquisite. At launch it did have quite a bit of graphical errors in terms of texture detail. But with the most recent update, they fixed it tremendously. With how detailed this game is, i am surprised with how optimized Game Science made this game.(I am rockin a 12900k, 32gb ram and a Titan XP) and was able to run this game with a mix of very high and high settings 1440p with an AVG of 45FPS without FG. Yes i could lower the settings and add FG into the mix for more FPS. But i honestly didnt need too.IN CONCLUSIONIf this game does not win GOTY. Sh*t is rigged. But we all know that it is rigged. And idk call of duty is probably gonna win or some bullsh*t. If you are skeptical on buying this game, Just buy it dawg. its incredible and worth the money.GAMEPLAY: 10/10STORY: 8.5/10VISUALS: 10/10MUSIC: 10/10",Recommended,1719,75.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

I don’t want to comment on how great the game is compared with others since I haven’t played many.However, this game to me is inspirational. In my day job, I build softwares. In the past years, I found myself in endless voidness. While I poured my soul into the work out of care and passion, it didn’t repay me with any kind of reward. I didn’t find meaning of ‘going the extra mile’ or simply be good at what I do.This is a good game. And as a good game it showed me how a group of talented, dedicated, determined, and passionate engineers and artists working together could achieve. They proved to me I wasn’t wrong when I also wanted to pursue excellency instead of simple success. I can imagine the countless sleepless nights the teams spent polishing every intricate details and now they can be really proud of what they made.

There's plenty of lighting and performance issues (even on a pretty solid machine). The level design is okay for the first two chapters, but after that, it takes a hard plunge. The prison sequence in Chapter 3 (with pits that kills you – I guess we don't need invisible walls for this part) was not fun. Cutscene damage several times during a boss fight that takes you to half your health? I probably haven't seen a more stupid gameplay decision in a long time. Well, maybe apart from the fact that this game doesn't have even the simplest of maps. Plus, the story is very hard to follow and at times nonsensical. And there's no pausing during cutscenes because I guess life never gets in the way, right? All in all, this game is fun until it isn't.

Many later bosses are too easy or are difficult in a boring way like having very few moves but with long attack chains.And then there is the basic mechanics of the game. it wants to be quick like Sekiro, but is slow and unresponsive, and worst of all inconsistent. I have a good, PC and experience no frame drops whilst playing, yet the time it takes to recover from being hit or making certain attacks is not always the same. About half of my deaths to certain bosses is because of the inconsistent/slow responsiveness, which otherwise where rather easy bosses.Despite all of this I still recommend the game just wait till it is like 33% or more off, it is not worth it at its full price, which is why I am giving it a thumbs down on steam.

5433,"A Game That Will Stick With YouFrom the first fight, I was completely hooked by Black Myth: Wukong’s gameplay. It feels fluid, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. The developers have truly mastered the balance between challenge and reward—every encounter feels meaningful, whether you’re up against a minor foe or a towering boss. Combat is where the game truly shines, with a deep system that rewards skill, strategy, and quick reflexes.Wukong’s transformation abilities add a dynamic twist to the gameplay. Switching between forms to gain an edge in combat or solve puzzles creates a level of depth that goes beyond traditional action RPGs. Every transformation comes with its own unique abilities, encouraging experimentation and tactical thinking. This variety in combat kept the game fresh for me, even dozens of hours in. There’s always something new to learn, some new strategy to master, and that constant sense of progression is incredibly rewarding.The boss fights, in particular, are a standout. They are epic in scale, with each encounter feeling like an event in itself. These battles are challenging, but never unfair—victory feels earned and exhilarating. The game encourages you to learn from your mistakes, and overcoming these powerful foes delivers an immense sense of satisfaction.Black Myth: Wukong is one of those rare games that feels like an instant classic. It has heart, depth, and the kind of polish that makes it stand out among even the best AAA titles. From the jaw-dropping visuals and fluid combat to the rich storytelling and deep lore, this game offers so much to players without ever asking for anything in return beyond the initial purchase. It’s a complete package—a masterpiece in every sense of the word.I finished the game feeling exhilarated, satisfied, and yet somehow wanting more—an incredible testament to the experience it offers. I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong is not just one of the best games I’ve played in recent years, but one of the best games I’ve ever played, period. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you, immerse you in a rich world, and offer hours of compelling gameplay without the need for microtransactions, look no further.Rating: 5/5 – This game is a triumph.",Recommended,1893,109.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

5445,"Black Myth Wukong - looks Gorgeous!There's so much love put in it!I Didn't knew what to expect when first playing but when i started, the game reminded me alot of NIOH2.it was Definately not Elden Ring.The fighting style, the same checkpoint thingies, the special abilities from monsters and the skill systems are NIOH2 like.I don't play on high end pc and it runs smooth and still i see the game in it's glory, gameplay is amazing, the battles are fluid the combos are rewarding if you make them right, the music is lovely, alot of good cutscenes, highly recommended.The bosses feels great, they are alive - one cries when you beat it, the other licks his wounds and so on... - they don't feel boring or stupid.It's an unforgettable adventure you must enjoy.",Recommended,627,27.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

5459,"I can recommend this only if you enjoyed something like Ninja Gaiden. I thought this might be for me since I completed Demon's Souls, Bloodborne+DLC, Dark Souls 1+3, Elden Ring, Lords of the Fallen.I found it to have most of the souls tropes but without the risk and reward. You can respec at anytime, but don't lose anything if you die.The production values are great and it's a real shame to abandon this one as I wanted to experience the interesting levels and lore. Unfortunately it's just too hard for me to continue, so it must be a skills issue or something hasn't clicked. I didn't feel the combat was as satisfying as souls games as otherwise I might have persevered.No map is fine, but without a trail of bodies I found it tricky to navigate where I had already been. There's no denying it's epic and beautiful, but bosses reminded me of Melina's fight with her punishing combos + AOE.Maybe a hidden item or co-op might have helped with my lack of skills.",Recommended,792,10.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

5462,"I had high hopes when I saw the first trailer years ago, and it has exceeded my expectations. First ever game that literally follows journey to the west storyline not just some loose adaptation, high pace action gameplay that isn't too easy nor too difficult. And the game is so huge for a hack and slash type game.Pros:- graphic fidelity (are you ♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me levels), not just during cutscenes, gameplay too!- good story compared to other similar titles, which is kinda unfair since its based on a legendary novel, but good job nonetheless- bosses and overall enemy variety is ridiculous- fairly long game for such genre. Each of the 6 chapters is pretty sizable. Chapter 3 alone is the size of a typical hack and slash game- combat is very cool looking. You only use 1 weapon, but boy are those movesets stylish. You really get to experience being Sun Wukong!- boss fights are the GOAT! Especially the main ones, not gonna spoilCons:- several known characters from the novel are missing from the game- certain story parts not fully fleshed out, feels unsatisfying- a few minor technical issues that happen occasionally, nothing seriousI'd say that this game is a must play and you would be missing out if you didn't, but you probably knew that already.",Recommended,1043,65.3 hrs on record,Posted: October 3

5475,"神了At the moment of this review, I have 100% completed the game, beat NG++++, discovered every single little minute secret there is in this game, and uninstalled.Never have I felt so empty after a game's completion. This is the fruition of a few generations' childhood dreams, the attention to detail in every single story line is beyond perfection. If you haven't read/watched Journey To The West, you can still understand the story, but for a 90s kid who had read it, learned it in school and watched it on TV, this is the equivalent of imagination come true. (四妹 deserved so much better and I hope she comes back for the DLC)The combat is buttery smooth and endlessly fun. 4 different ways to avoid damage with all slightly different timings make it feel like you're a master of JingGuBang at the end of the game. 90+ boss designs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of this world, 寅虎 is probably the coolest guy there ever was. The 4 Dragons blending into the poems is a rare literary gem. The music using the original OST + an orchestra is a touch of genius. 杨戬 the pretty boy is amusingly frustrating... I feel so privileged to have been able to play this game in original Chinese, the dialogue, the music, the calligraphy, the scenery (some places I've been in life!)... everything permeates and exudes culture. This is perhaps the most impressive cultural exportation after pandas lolThis feels like a more forgiving souls-like, the difficulty is on par, but the respawn is more merciful.In 2024, there isn't a game that I'd recommend more.The DLC can't get here soon enough!",Recommended,1290,131.0 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

5537,"Black Myth: Wukong is most likely gonna be my choice for game of the year 24, due to the following reasons:-Easily gets into my top 5 most stunning world designs I've seen in my 27 years of gaming. As a 3d artist, I simply can't stop admiring the unlimited amount of love for detail and creativity that went into designing this game. It's breathtaking and nothing short of Elden Ring in this regard. Huge props to the creative designers who worked on this game, it is absolute masterclass level and hugely inspiring.-Gameplay loop is still quite satisfying after 30h, I always stayed hooked, always stayed excited about the next crazy boss, level design, equipment or further leveling my build - eventhough I pretty much stayed equipped with the first ever spirit I found (one of the strongest in the game) as well as with the starter stance. The game somehow manages to stay interesting and fresh.-While the boss battles can be tough and really challenging, I never found Black Myth to be overly unfair or unbeatable. Whenever I struggle I find myself resorting to re-skilling and re-equipping to push defenses and weaknesses against the current boss and so far that's always worked. The game always gives you enough sources of advantage, you just have to be willing to use them properly.-Fighting system, while it could be a bit more manifold in its basic animations and moves (I prefered Nioh 2 in that regard), overall offers enough to stay engaging. I certainly find it more engaging than the From Software system, which I always found lacking severly in fluidity.-Voice acting and animation work are top notch, the motion capture effort greatly shows, it's a delight to watch the characters move.-There's essentially no real, obvious overall story in Black Myth, and I frankly don't care at all, because: the moments that drive the narrative are always fun and interesting to watch unfold. They are creative and characteristic enough that I don't need anything further than that when it comes to storytelling. The custscenes are often cinematic as hell, the quirky characters always play the gallery utterly well, the murals and videos pieces at the end of each chapter are pieces of art, the dark buddhist temple aesthetics that hold the levels togeher, never fail to take my breath away. All that combined gives me more than enough to enjoy Black Myth's narrative elements, even without following a complex overall story. The world design is the story here.-Technic-wise it's all smooth and well for me. Graphics are fantastic, short loading times, no stuttering on very high setup. Haven't encountered a single bug in 30h, considering I started it shortly after release that's almost a mircale in nowadays ""rush the release and fix it later (or not)""-game landscape.The negatives:-the permanent presence of invisible walls are a real bummer, especially considering the killer world design would have easily allowed better ways to limit the playable areas and with all the effort that went into it I really don't understand that decision. Quite a bummer, probably the biggest one for me in this game.-I saw a survey recently, saying that around 70% of players use the basic smash stance (like I do), which shows that the other 2 stances aren't great gameplay choices. I wish the devs would have made them more attractive to players, since ending up with the basic starter elements until the end of the game always is something I find strange. It takes away a portion of the reward feeling of progress. The longer I play, the stronger my skill choices should become after all. I tried the other stances for like 10 minutes each, and they didn't feel like giving me any advantages at all, so I sticked with the basic.-Same with the spirit skills. If the very first of countless choices you find throughout the game is one of the strongest, why even try any others? Most of them even give you disadvantages in stats, making them utterly useless and nonsensical. I don't think I even tried any others at any point, because I never felt that I needed to and I also didn't wanna lose the defense push from Wandering Wight. A better kind of balancing would have surely been needed here.Overall Black Myth: Wukong is great fun and an absolute masterclass in creativity and I hope for a propsering future for Game Science.",Recommended,3587,39.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 2
5538,"Just completed the game and I can honestly say it was brilliant. I have played a lot of souls-like games and though I can say this was one of the easier ones I have played, I can also say it is one of the most beautiful ones I have played. The story, ark and animations are of top quality showing that developers do not need 1000s of staff members to create a top class game. You just need a group of passionate created that want to produce a work of art instead of the money quick scheme most big developers are going for. Not only is it beautiful but it is challenging enough to keep the player interested and the combat system with the skill tree system is amazing. the exploration is brilliant a specially chapter 6 is quite unique. If I had to mention one thing that disappointed me it would be that it ended so soon. the secrets the hidden quests and the main story was so brilliant I just want to play more.If you want a top quality game without the season pass junk and all of the other money quick garbage most big companies do then this is the game for you.

My only problem with this game and I know this is not much but I hate a game without a map, you can easily lost on the labyrinth of stages, I guess this adds a challenge too by the devs. Come on, guys! the stages is ginormous it should have at lease a map. Overall this a contender for Game of the Year at lease, IMHO. Highly recommended game, it is worth your money and time. Enjoy your Journey!",Recommended,634,216.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

5549,"Black Myth: Wukong – A Masterpiece of Old-School GamingBlack Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game that truly reminds us of what gaming is supposed to be: fun, immersive, and a work of art. As someone who has played modern games from Western studios, I can confidently say Black Myth: Wukong stands head and shoulders above most of them.This game embraces what made classic action RPGs so memorable while also pushing the boundaries of modern gaming technology. It’s old-school fun, plain and simple, without any of the gimmicks that have plagued Western releases in recent years. There's no hand-holding, no unnecessary microtransactions, and no bloated downloadable content that should have been included in the base game. This is a pure experience, just like the legendary games we grew up with.In contrast to the Western games that feel more like cash-grabs these days, Black Myth: Wukong focuses on perfecting its core gameplay mechanics. The combat system is challenging and rewarding, drawing inspiration from the Soulsborne formula, but with a unique twist that makes each encounter feel fresh and intense. The visuals and world-building are nothing short of breathtaking. From the mystical creatures to the gorgeously designed landscapes, every detail feels painstakingly crafted to transport you into a living, breathing rendition of ancient Chinese mythology.What sets it apart from Western modern games is the respect it has for the player. There’s no spoon-feeding or over-the-top tutorials. The game trusts you to learn, adapt, and grow, just like the games of the past. You’re rewarded for your skill, patience, and exploration. It brings back that sense of accomplishment that has been missing in a lot of mainstream games recently.The storyline, inspired by the Journey to the West, is both nostalgic and fresh. It combines epic lore with thrilling action, making you feel like you’re part of a grand adventure that transcends time. This is a game for those who long for the days when gaming was about creating timeless experiences, not just selling digital skins or season passes.In summary, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play for anyone who appreciates true gaming craftsmanship. It’s a brilliant return to form, standing proudly against the wave of modern Western titles that prioritize profit over passion. Highly recommended for gamers who want an authentic, challenging, and deeply satisfying experience!",Recommended,2063,38.7 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

It is a total waste of time.It's linear, you don't make a character, you don't choose a weapon or playstyle, you don't alter the story.(The story doesn't make any sense, either. Everyone is hostile for absolutely no reason and you're literally teleported to random locations with no context.)The bosses are all cheating, all the time. They can turn and hit you in a fraction of a second during their attack animations no matter where you are, they have unlimited stamina, and insane HP bars. Just remember all the worst parts of any souls like game, and you will find it here.The egregious example: You must use light attack combos (cringe) which lock you into a multi hit animation (cringe) and then the boss can suddenly decide to give itself hyper armor AT ANY TIME to ignore your attack (cringe) and then instantly stun lock you with his own attacks (cringe).Elden Ring is far easier and more rewarding.",Not Recommended,800,11.1 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

Not everyone is a gamer, not idle, people go to work, not everyone is stupid like me to spend so much time on this game. Those over 30 who just want to play a very cool game, simply cannot play it.

Unlike proper Souls games, this one doesn't make you sweat as much. The difficulty is manageable, and you can progress without feeling overly punished, which makes the gameplay more enjoyable for players who prefer a less intense challenge.The lore is also super interesting—based on Chinese mythology, which makes everything feel fresh and unique.

5702,"Iam really enjoying the game so far. Iam in chapter 4 and the game feels fluid and amazingSo ill give my thoughts on itGRAPHIC: 10/10, rtx visual effects are really well done and performance is great, some astonishing areas and places and atmosphere is really well doneCOMBAT: I would say 9/10 just cause of some camera movement on some enemies/bosses, but its pretty much better version and fluid version of God OF War where Wukong has much more utility and abilites to choose from and talent system is well done for each style of gameplay. Perfect dodges are really interesting to pull of and to make build around it same as transformation system etc.PERFORMANCE: 10/10 never had any issues with the game even before patch, the game runs smooth and there is micro stuttering at the start when you are discovering some new areas/assets but all in all 90% of the game runs smoothSTORY: 8/10 .I didn't really pay attention to details of the story since its really boss driven game, pretty simple but unique appeal of the character from Chinese mythology/literature.SOUND: 8/10, there is some sound issues where in some cases voices wont be heard or they sound like they are coming from a tunnel or some sort. I definitely recommend it to play it on Chinese and not on English since its much immersive. Swords clashing and everything is really smooth and no delay in combat sounds. Atmosphere sounds really fits into each areas you explore and boss soundtracks are great to give you boost when you do acrobatics with your character.GAMEPLAY: 9/10 just cause camera hates you in some cases but overall the game is really fun and interesting. Exploring some rare areas will give you boost in materials/armor/character etc so its worth picking up everything and opening every chest to give yourself power boost of a character. Some bosses are really challenging and will take you few tries to beat them.I would say the game has moderate difficulty and some quite challenging bosses.I strongly recommend you to try this game, it really deserves all the love its getting atm.It is not repetitive as some may say, if you like hack and slashy challenging soulslike combat mechanics then the game is really for you!",Recommended,1829,61.5 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

Okay, it can happen it is early stages of release. Benefit of the doubt, i will just go away and come back later for the game. I finally decide to come back after over a month of release seeing new patches about ""fixing"" stuff. Now the game can not even be launched. 60 dolars for a game that does not improve on it but digresses. If you are working a regular 8-5 job expecting to get home have a gaming session on this, skip ahead. You never know when you need to aimlessly look for ways to fix this, not encounter that, how to improve your frame rates etc. when it is clearly supposed to be handled by the 60 dolar charging devs. Game announced years before release, finally releases and somehow i am still unable to play it having it for 2 months. Thank you for my 3 hour play time with possibly 3 more on wasting how to ""unstuck"" a boss and an extra few on ""how to solve the launch problem on wukong"" with no solution on a users end.",Not Recommended,1070,6.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 2

5726,"Although I can name few problems, this game is still 10/10 and highly recommended. I do think this is an industry changing product. Everything is done right - outstanding art, fun to engage game systems (all of them) and core game mechanics, awesome (mini)boss designs and overall a great variety of enemies, progression / balancing / RPG elements are nailed, endgame content (aka NG+) is a thing, epic cinematics, ... I can go on but you got the point.Some problems worth mentioning (but again, the value and fun by playing the game outweigh those by a lot):- keyboard remapping!!! It's basically non existent. Please, I want that Rock Solid on my mouse trigger...- occasional performance issues (mostly tied to certain areas) even on a powerful gaming configuration- some bosses and mini bosses have questionable mechanics and broken hitboxes (when I say ""some"" I mean less than 10 out of 100+)- sometimes camera is really tricky...- (personal opinion) I miss a map - a simple one that only allows custom markers with notes. No matter it's a linear game, some chapters have pretty overwhelming layoutI'm currently halfway through my first NG+ (almost 100 hours gameplay) and I can't see myself stop playing the game anytime soon.

5760,"Black Myth: Wukong – An Epic and Stunning JourneyBlack Myth: Wukong, delivers on the promise of an ambitious, breathtaking adventure that was first teased in the 2020 trailer. Despite the initial skepticism, the game lives up to the hype generated back then.The excitement surrounding Wukong rests on three main pillars: beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay, and the familiar mythology of Journey to the West. The game breathes new life into the well-known story, combining stunning visuals with gameplay that perfectly captures the agility of the Monkey King.The game's similarities with FromSoftware titles become apparent, especially in its difficulty and need for pattern memorization during boss fights. Yet, Black Myth: Wukong also sets itself apart—its progression system is much simpler, focusing on skill trees rather than the extensive attribute customization typical of Soulslike games.Unlike most games of the genre, Wukong is far less punitive. Although challenging, it avoids the punishing consequences of losing significant progress upon death, making it more forgiving. Combat focuses on mastering timing, resource management, and using spells, each with distinct effects, offering strategic depth to the player.The bosses in Wukong are generally entertaining, though there are instances where unfair hitboxes can make certain encounters frustrating. Moreover, navigating between boss battles can sometimes feel confusing, and the exploration lacks incentive, particularly toward the end of the campaign, which introduces an unnecessarily challenging sequence.Visually, Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of impressive. It blends stunning graphics with anime and stop-motion sequences that add emotional depth to the story, although the episodic nature of the plot can leave some character motivations unclear.Despite a few missteps, mainly due to the studio's inexperience, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic game, showcasing a remarkable technical achievement. It’s an ambitious adaptation of Journey to the West, and it sets the stage for Game Science to refine their approach and reach even greater heights in future titles.",Recommended,1833,60.9 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

5763,"Black Myth: Wukong has garnered significant attention for its breathtaking visuals, fluid gameplay, and innovative storytelling. As a game inspired by the legendary Chinese novel Journey to the West, it has impressed both fans of the source material and gamers worldwide with its faithful representation of Chinese folklore.Here are some key highlights of the game:Stunning Visuals: Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game features incredibly detailed environments, lifelike character models, and smooth animations. The landscapes range from lush forests to mystical temples, creating an immersive world that draws players in. The attention to detail in lighting and particle effects makes every battle and scene feel epic.Dynamic Combat System: The combat is fast-paced, fluid, and highly skill-based. Players can transform into various creatures and use different abilities, offering a wide range of strategies in battle. Each fight feels unique, thanks to a mix of martial arts, magic, and mythical transformations. The boss battles are particularly memorable, requiring quick reflexes and tactical thinking.Engaging Storyline: The game takes the essence of Journey to the West but adds a darker and more mature tone, making it appealing to both fans of traditional folklore and those new to the story. The protagonist, Sun Wukong, has a rich character arc, and the narrative intertwines with his legendary abilities and trickster personality.Innovative Gameplay Mechanics: Beyond traditional action RPG elements, Black Myth: Wukong offers innovative mechanics, such as the ability to mimic enemy abilities and use them to your advantage. This adds depth and variety to both combat and exploration.Cultural Representation: It stands out for its deep respect for Chinese culture and mythology, presenting a game world that feels authentic yet fantastical. For many, this is a fresh and exciting perspective not often seen in mainstream games.Final Thoughts: Black Myth: Wukong is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated action RPGs of the decade. With its stunning visuals, innovative gameplay, and culturally rich narrative, it promises an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you're a fan of Chinese mythology or just love beautifully crafted action games, this is one title to keep on your radar.",Recommended,1961,87.8 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

5779,"125小时，三周目完成，全收集八十一难之后，感觉五段棍势开大圣模式太短了，就一分钟。其实完全可以改成常驻，因为四周目开始每个Boss血量和攻击爆增，容错率极低，我竟然被广智和灵虚子秒了哈哈。125 hours, 3 play-throughs, all 81 achievements later, I finally unlocked Wukong stance. While every time it requires 5 focus points to unlock, it only lasts one minute...It could have been permanent in my opinion, giving how every boss starting from 4th play-though has much more HP and attack. There is little room for error, I even got killed by Guangzhi and Lingxuzi. lol.前三周目可以按中英中语言来游玩，有些配音非常有意思。如果有高端显卡4090和42~55寸左右LG的OLED电视/显示器，推荐至少其中一个周目画质用TSR然后开到100采样率。阴影，特性，反射开高，其他选项开影视级。关闭光线追踪。虽然帧数可能会降到50~60，但画面细节确实是最丰富的，几乎没有画面锯齿以及颗粒感，比DLSS好很多。另外如果是13代或14代英特尔CPU可以在MSI主板软件MSI中心里调静音模式，这样就不会玩到一半闪退。不得不说，虚幻5引擎真是厉害，这绝对是今年我玩过画面最好的游戏，希望它可以拿年度游戏，冲！I tried the first play through in Chinese, English and Chinese. Some of the voice acting are exceptional. If you got a 4090 GPU and 42~55 inch LG OLED monitor/TV, I recommend at least in one of the play-through to use TSR and 100 super resolution. While turning shadow, visual effect and reflection to Very High, other settings to Cinematic. Ray tracing off. FPS may dip to 50~60 but the visual fidelity is amazing. This way, there is no aliasing or double-shadow, like in DLSS. Also if you have 13th & 14th Intel CPU, you can set MSI Center -> User Scenario -> Silent. It will lower the CPU frequency, not affect the game performance much and avoid crushing.I'm in awe of Unreal Engine 5 and how much Black Myth Wukong has achieved in graphic quality and game-play innovation.

If you look at the global achievements on Steam, over 1/3 of users have the ""Six Senses Secured"" achievement which means they have completed the full story.Considering that the entire background and stories involved in this game is insanely huge, I have to say they have done extremely well in delivering the story - if you aren't familiar with the journey of the west stories, just trust me.I can see how challenging it can be for most western players to follow the stories but if you actually played the game, you would have seen how much effort the team has put into creating a profile story for EVERY SINGLE MOB in the game, not to mention the animations after each chapter and the dialogues from the main characters (Although I do admin that it's difficult translating these dialogues into languages other than Chinese. You always lose something through translation). But the thing is, even if you don't completely follow the full story, this game is still incredible!I'm looking forward to the DLC already!",Recommended,1098,175.6 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

5862,"TL;DR: Amazing game with a great story (Based on Journey to the West). The most breathtaking scenery I have probably ever seen in a game. First few times on each map, I rarely sprinted just to take my time and look around the outstanding details this masterpiece has to offer. Truly, a game worth calling a ""Masterpiece"". I'd give it a 9/10.Combat is great. Even though the majority of the emphasis is put on light attacks, there's still quite a few helpful and powerful skills to obtain that can and will give you the edge on fights. A wonderful detail I love about it is that it gives you very specific items that counter very specific enemies or situations. Personally, I didn't use much of anything except the basic skills because I'm weird and I felt that I could get through better with those, but I can definitely see people at the very least enjoying the other options too.Scenery is absolutely 10/10. I love every single place I've been to in this game, with the exception of chapter 4, which I didn't like much, because I found the layout to be very confusing for no reason. But maybe it's supposed to be this way. As I briefly stated earlier, the devs put a lot of love, affection and care into the details spread around the maps, that oftentimes provide you with tidbits of extra lore. And that's a big plus for me.Apart from the gameplay cutscenes, which are phenomenal, you are also blessed with some high quality animated chapter-end cutscenes that further explain the story or backstory about what happened. They are quite short but are very concise and easy to understand, even just visually. Not to mention, very pretty.Controls with a controller (I haven't played with Keyboard + Mouse) are quite easy and straightforward and difficulty is medium-hard. As a souls-like games' enthusiast, I found most bosses to be normal difficulty. I usually killed most of them in 1-3 lives, except very specific ones and two more that were, in my opinion, annoyingly OP just for the sake of being annoyingly OP. Apart from that, I love the fact that there's so many bosses around. Makes me feel like I'm actually fighting with other very powerful entities instead of squeaky toys and trash mobs.Regarding music and sound overall, it's quite good, nothing extremely out there but nothing to scoff at either. There's definitely some banger tracks in there that you will most likely enjoy. Thanks for reading <3",Recommended,1995,67.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

5877,"The game is great and worth getting even at full price but it isn't the 10/10 some people are making it out to be. It does some things great like the number of bosses and the variety in their attack styles but other things like the story and polish it falls short on.Audio: 9/10I played with the English voices and they sounded great, some of them have a British accent but it wasn't bad and I think the voices fit. The game has great surround sound and music. I have heard for the Chinese players there is music from a popular TV series from the 80s about the Journey to the West that a lot of them grew up on so that is a nice touch for them.I have a 7900XT and played at 4K 60FPS. The game does look great when you stop to take in the surroundings but the game forces you to use upscaling which is a negative to me. I don't have DLSS so I am not sure how it looks in this game but having tested the other 3 available upscalers (FSR, TSR, XESS) they all have some drawbacks and are not as good as native. Setting the upscaler to 100 does not seem to set it to native. In the Benchmark tool they released before the full game it showed even at 100 there was different results between the 3 upscalers and in the full game if you turn on motion blur to strong and spin around you can still see ghosting around his head so the upscaling is still on. I am also pretty sure this is not FSR 3.1 which has the new upscaler so I would like to see that added at some point. Turning on Frame Gen with both FSR and TSR causes trees in some locations to constantly flicker when moving. I was able to hide this by turning motion blur on but I normally do not play with motion blur so that is kind of annoying but to minimize the visual issues upscaling causes it is needed in this game.I eventually settled on leaving FSR to 50 with the Very High graphics preset to get a near constant 60FPS. Without the flickering from Frame Gen I only had to deal with the ghosting from upscaling but with motion blur set to weak I was able to hide it enough that It didn't bother me for the rest of the game. Outside of the upscaling issue the game looks amazing.There are some translation errors but they have been fixing them overtime. The story however is the biggest issue I had with the game. It takes place after the Journey to the West so before buying the game I watched a several videos on the Journey to the West to have a frame of reference in the game. But even with that the story is presented in a way that you will probably be confused if you have not actually read the novel. A lot of the details that elevate a story to being great will be missed so you will need to find an explanation from someone online who has read the novel to fully appreciate the story. The game is definitely made with the expectation you know the Journey to the West novel well. The game does try to add some back story on characters through journal entries you get from beating enemies but I would say the majority of them were just random tales or poetry that while interesting were not relevant to the main story. Some definitely did explain more about the major characters and the story but those were still not enough in my opinion.After you beat a chapter you unlock a mural of events relevant to that chapter. If you zoom in you will find the option to click on parts of it and a narrator will give some brief dialogue that does help but if you don't zoom it's easy to skip past it and never get the dialogue. The dialogue there is usually helpful but they are brief and leave you wanting more. With all the effort they put into the mostly irrelevant journal entries I think it would have been better to reduce the journal entries and instead have a small detailed recap of the parts of the Journey to the West that chapter is based on before or after a chapter.There are 6 chapters in total and after each chapter there is a cool animated video but they have little dialogue and the stories can seem out of place. Sometimes the story is in reference to the main story of the chapter you just finished so you understand what it's about but other times it's about a side story in the upcoming chapter so you have no idea what it was about. If you read the novel though you will recognize the character and have an idea of what is coming up. It's possible in the one where it references a side story for you to miss it in the chapter and then be even more confused about what the previous video was about since the character never appeared. In other cases the video references something that happened in the previous chapter but the characters are in another form so you have no idea who it is unless you read the novel and make the connection.It's a shame because there is a really good story here with great characters and acting but it feels like a lot of the time the characters aren't given enough time to have the impact they could have because the story is told with the expectation of you knowing the backstory already. Now all that said if you don't mind having to go read a bunch of forum posts or read the book the story in the game is actually pretty interesting and the secret/true ending hints at what the DLC should be about.I have seen some people say it's too hard and others it's too easy. I would say the difficulty is closer to God of War and the Souls games are harder. The game does a great job of making it feel like an actual journey though. You start off weak and the game makes you learn the mechanics early on or you won't be able to beat the boss. As I gained new abilities the following chapters felt easier overall. I had the most deaths in Chapter 1 as I was learning but after that the number of tries I needed to beat a boss dropped significantly. In the later chapters they raise the difficulty again so it doesn't get too easy. NG+ is done really well too because the best items are only in NG+ so there is an actual reason to do NG+ and it's satisfying to destroy early bosses.There are over 100 bosses and most have different fighting styles and don't use unfair moves that insta kill. The combat is fun and can be mixed up as you get multiple spells, transformations, staff stances, and weapons. But there are some bugs and things the game does not explain. Sometimes your character just won't dodge or use an item in the middle of a fight. Sometimes this is due to status effects like being shocked but the game never explains the effects of these statuses so a lot of people think the combat is laggy. Other times it is due to input lag or a bug. I have tested it out with my controller and seen outside of fights there is sometimes noticeable input lag. I was able to fix it by restarting the game but if it starts in the middle of a fight you are stuck with it as changing the controller didn't help.Level design is mostly linear but I like it because it's more curated so you get a better experience. Even though it is linear there is still a lot to explore. I never had an issue with the invisible walls like some of these people claim. It never broke the atmosphere for me and 99% of the time I could tell where a wall was. The worst area for me was the open world chapter because it is mostly empty so I had to waste time exploring a boring area. There is a snow chapter that is semi open world and it was the second worst area because it was a pain to explore. That chapter is also the one most people have performance issues on due to size and snow. Outside of 1 area the environment is not an obstacle like in Souls games but the camera can mess you up sometimes.Even with those issues it's still a great game that I recommend and I can't wait for the DLC.5=Average6=Decent7=Good8=Great9=Amazing10=Perfect",Recommended,6252,118.4 hrs on record,Posted: October 1
5878,"This game is outstanding. Not only does the game manage to deliver on the Journey to the West story, but they manage to do so and keep you engaged throughout.It's still a controversial topic whether this game is a souls-like or not, either way I feel like the game manages to adhere to elements that makes a souls-like fun, challenging and engaging. This game has you fight both optional and, of course, mandatory bosses which all feels like their own.This is an absolute MUST play if you like skill based games, with great stories and ever greater gameplay! Though, if its replayability you're looking for, this game probably isn't for you.NOTE! For anyone about to, or is actively playing this game.

Ma Tianba didn't show up on the seceond location probably cause I beat the earth wolf before i went to his location in black wind mountain), some thing were obvious but some were like zombies easter eggs. if you would like to learn about chinese mythology, the game is a good start but not the 100% source, every enemy has a codex of lore dedicated to them, some are stories of were the monster comes from, some is in-game lore.

Not to talk about how badly telegraphed the grab attacks are, which also take up like 25% of the attacks bosses have.

5920,"There's is a part of my brain that says this game does not quite deserve a 10 out of 10. A big part of my heart wants to give it the full score, which is what I ultimately decided on. This game had its hooks in me for two full weeks. I couldn't put it down. People call it a soul-sy, boss rush with God of War elements, and I would call it a Wukong-like in the hopes that this game studio will release many more Wukong-likes in the future.What I liked:* Fighting feels really good. You're quick on your feet, spells are fun, transformations are great.* All the bosses are beautifully designed. I think there are at least 90+ bosses in this game, and even all the dragons are unique.* It's the right kind of difficult. Exploration didn't really faze me much. I hardly ever died, so unlike in souls-likes where I run to the next save point and then backtrack, I could meticulously explore here. Most bosses were 1-try kills, others were 3-try kills and only a few took me more than an hour. Perfect!* You can respec your build whenever.* Surprisingly the story is good. The mythological part of it was really enticing and there's so much more to the boss fights than just the fight itself. There's an emotional part to fighting the beings you fight for story purposes. The animated parts between chapters is fun too.* The side quests are hard to find but very rewarding (and needed if you want to unlock the secret boss).* The different chapters take place in new environs and all of them are impressive.* The music is quite epic at times.What I didn't like:* Chapter 6 is called ""unfinished"" and it feels unfinished. It's empty and your new ability makes that even more apparent. I feel that the devs were crunched for time. It's honestly why I feel this game should maybe get a 9/10 because the last 6 hours were not very enjoyable, but it's worth pushing through.I hope more games are released in this series!",Recommended,1563,48.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

I do say the smash stance is a little bit OP compared to other stances since NG+3 and more, you use the smash stance more than the wukong stance because certain buffs and builds make it deal some severe damage even at that stage.

5939,"From an audiovisual standpoint this is one of the more impressive games I've ever played. The sense of scale, lighting, animation, cinematography, sound design and music are all some of the best in class.Unfortunately, games have gameplay and that's were I feel this game falls flat on its face.First, the level design is severely undercut by the level of detail in the world leading to uncountable false affordances and leading the player directly into invisible walls. In such a linear game where the designer has nearly full control over what perspective the player will approach and view events from, this feels really under-baked.Second, progression. I feel like the game completely blew it's entire progression load in the first third of the game leaving the latter 60% to languish in menial stat buffs with no real gameplay alterations. I wish there had been more gating to some of the more mechanically complex options to make me feel like I was actually improving, but since I had settled into a playstyle all my skill points went to health, mana, attack and defense upgrades which were not satisfying to unlock.Third, narrative. The opening cutscene is by far the best moment in the entire game. After that point you are reduced to a silent protagonist in a character driven story where you have absolutely no character. Everyone surrounding the Destined One is a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels like the game expects you to have a preexisting understanding of the myth of Sun Wukong since, through the entire game, I had no idea who anyone was, why there was so much beef between literally everyone or why that mattered to the Destined One. Bajie is the absolute worst offender since he never shuts up, is a complete prick to everyone, and I still have no idea why I was supposed to be listening to him. And I never felt like the game gave a enough of a ♥♥♥♥ to tell me. Maybe it's a translation issue, but it had a major impact on my ability to relate or sympathize with anyone and I came away from it disliking almost everyone we interacted with along the way.And lastly, and most importantly, combat and enemy design. The sheer volume of enemy variety and animations are a detriment to the gameplay experience due to the sheer lack of familiarity you have with every new set of enemies. Other games let the player measure their progression by putting familiar enemies with knowable health and attacks as a gauge of the player's progress, but since every single new area of the game just throws a brand new suite of enemies at you you never get that measuring stick. It's just constantly learning new attacks and timings.Pair that with the latter half of the game having a severe drop in the quality of the animation tells for the player to react to, flaily and unreadable attack combos that go on for what feel like minutes with not enough time to react, attack or heal, a huge number of instant-damage AOE attacks and player attack cancellation windows and spell cast time that make Dark Souls 1's ultra greatswords feel responsive, the whole second half of this game just felt like an absolute slog to get through.If it had had player facing difficulty options, maybe that would have shifted how I felt about it, but as is this is an absolute visual masterpiece with about 30% of the game being fun and interesting and then pulling teeth for the last two thirds. If you make it to the snowy forest, you've already seen the best the game has to offer.But given how poorly designed and short the last two areas are, I think the game knows that.Buy it for $20 max and play it with mods if you want to have fun. I genuinely regret playing this myself and not watching the cutscenes on YouTube. Those are by far the best part of the game and your expirence will be better having not suffered the game itself.",Not Recommended,3142,30.2 hrs on record,Posted: October 1

The boss battles are unique and super challenging (Erlang!!!!!!).It goes without saying that the graphics are incredible. I'm playing at 1440p on a 4080 Super/5800x3d. I'm playing with frame-gen and dlss and the game runs well. Some sections can give some slight hiccupps when the boss does something crazy or something flashy is happening on screen.I think Black Myth certainly has a shot at Game of the Year. It truly feels ""next gen"". Any fan of Soulslikes or action rpgs should buy this game without thinking. The team really put a lot of love into it, and you can feel it.It truly is a wonderful journey to the West.",Recommended,748,60.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 30

5969,"Good game, lots of style similarities to Elden Ring, however this has more bosses and is much more driven by bosses rather than lore and sidequests. The game is really balanced so far 4 chapters out of 6.Where it's bad is that it has invisible walls to keep you on path, and pathing/walking around is clunky on slopes. Since you are a monkey, it sucks that jumping really sucks and there's no climbing. The environment is less interactive such that it has less breakables than a souls game. The art is incredible (temples, environments, boss battles, enemy designs), which is the main seller for me for this game. It stands head and shoulders above what else I've seen, but I don't game that much. I think the difficulty is around the same as Elden ring if not a little easier. There's usually something to do so you can level up and do something on the side etc before fighting the main boss. It lacks features like pvp and co-op which is offered by games at the same price, but again, this is a single player game only, and is more like a playable story.",Recommended,863,67.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 30

They released it and it was a god dayum fine game from the get go.The transformations and builld diversity are impressive but not like in other games where you might have more weapons and playstyles. Still its very decent. There were like 3 bosses that were very challenging, rest was mostly easy if you play a lot of soulslikes. Mostly hidden bosses that were a challenge.So imho this is the best game for people to get started with the genre. Also it game out mostly bug free. I had 1 single crash over 50 hours of playtime and once i got stuck. In todays time and age they release games barley playable....This one was pristine.So Basically:(if you like soulslikes ofc.)Only thing that was negative is the fact, that you are a monkey but cant climb any small rocks or anything.

5999,"One of the best games ever played, phenomenal art design and creation, stood out among the many East Asian themed games, very unique in its own Chinese mythology background, given it is based on an already widely known chinese story, the new story is surprisingly engaging and intriguing, game took a while to get used, once you learned how to used the staff properly, it is a quite endearing weapon. Game play is never boring or repetitive, even when replaying the many small monsters to gain more experience, every time it feels just as challenging and fun as the first time.One suggestion is while the game is loading every time, is it possible to enable the reading of the story book during the idle game loading time, I really enjoy reading the background stories behind each monster, but it takes time to just sit there and read, and loading game also takes quite a bit time (my puter is), wouldn't be great to be able to read while you wait for the game to load?

6083,"I don't feel the ""this game is too difficult"" really captures my problem with this. Having played Elden Ring this game is easier but certainly challenging. The issues I have with this game is that there is no ability to reduce difficulty level, you cannot skip bosses, and there are no ways to progress your character further (make them stronger) before fighting the same boss you've die 20+ times to. You just have to suffer and grind it out and perfectly dodge all of the moves while doing slivers of damage. This game is annoying as hell. For someone who is a casual gamer I do not recommend this to those who have a limited amount of time to play and enjoy games. This game is more like a chore than a fun way to spend some free time.

There's a lot of build diversity. There isn't a ton of trash mobs to fight.The rough parts for me were a lot of the bosses are braindead easy when you get your skills and items leveled. There were times I'd kill a boss without it attacking a single time. Then you get other bosses that are input reading your skills which is incredibly frustrating. Some bosses ignore certain spells which can completely invalidate your build. Upgrading items is a finite thing and if you want to switch builds, especially late game, it could be next to impossible to upgrade your gear that far.All in all, it was a good experience but the frustrations really started to add up towards the end.",Recommended,710,44.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 30

Finally beat the final boss, credits start that you are unable to skip, so I Alt-F4 to exit in order to start new game plus. Silly me. The developers demand you acknowledge their effort before your game saves. The final boss is standing there waiting for me to beat him again so I can watch the credits like a good lemming. They actually punish the player for not sitting through the credits. It's so absurd and really left a sour taste in my mouth.

6256,"I had the chance to dive into this game early, drawn in by its impressive Gamescom trailer, and let me tell you—it has surpassed all my expectations in the best way possible. From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the sheer beauty and attention to detail in the graphics. The visuals are not just lifelike; they transport you into a world so vivid and immersive that it feels like you’re exploring a living, breathing landscape. Every scene is crafted with such precision, from the smallest environmental details to the grand, picturesque vistas, that it often feels more like you’re watching an epic film rather than playing a game.The cinematics are awe-inspiring, seamlessly blending into the gameplay, giving the whole experience a cinematic flow that’s almost movie-like. But what truly stands out for me is the incredible artwork throughout the game, particularly the anime-style epilogues that close each chapter. These moments are a brilliant artistic touch, and they bring a unique flair that’s rarely seen in this genre. Each epilogue is like a work of art on its own, offering a beautiful, hand-drawn break from the intense action and immersing you even deeper into the story.Now, I’m on my fifth playthrough, and I still find new details and moments to appreciate each time. The level of craftsmanship in both the design and storytelling makes it a game you can’t just experience once. There’s always something more to discover, be it in the intricacies of the combat, the depth of the world-building, or the stunning environments that are nothing short of mesmerizing.If there’s one area where the game didn’t quite hit the mark for me, it would be the English dubbing, particularly for Wukong. The audio felt slightly underwhelming compared to the rest of the game’s exceptional quality. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it didn’t fully capture the depth and intensity of the character in the way I had hoped. However, this is a minor gripe in what is otherwise a masterclass in game design.Overall, this game has been a phenomenal purchase—one that I can confidently recommend to any gamer, especially those who appreciate top-tier visuals, breathtaking art, and an unforgettable experience. It’s a true work of art in the gaming world, and I’m sure it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who plays it.",Recommended,1949,132.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

6299,"Objective 7/10Subjective 7/10Black Myth: Wukong is an action game which takes its elements from 'souls games' and implements them reasonably.The developers of the game are not good at telling the story and pulling the player into it. The story itself is more of a fan fiction pastiche of the ""Journey to the West"" novel than anything else.Combat is functional and it does its job. However, despite its many elements, it doesn't offer a variety of builds that would make them viable in use. In the end, I changed my build only once to beat Erlang, but other than that every other boss and enemy can be beaten easily with the same technique.It terms of difficulty, Black Myth: Wukong is an easier game than Elden Ring, Sekiro, Dark Souls III and many other 'souls-like' titles. It is one of the easiest in the genre. The variety of enemies and bosses is stellar.To those who wonder if this game is 'souls-like' or not, the answer is Yes and No. It offers much less RPG elements in variety of weapons, armours and builds. It offers much less challenging encounters with bosses and basic enemies, and it is not punishing in any way or form, or at least I didn't notice it. However, those who played Dark Souls games will recognise that the devs of Black Myth: Wukong played those games as well and they borrowed the general sceleton of those games to make their own action game.NG+ offers difficulty very similar to the base game, if not easier, considering all the upgrades I gained in the first play through and my knowledge of how to beat all the bosses.The biggest drawbacks of this game are its biomes and invisible walls, walls which are placed in places where the design of the environment suggests that you can go through or jump through, only to find out you cannot because of that invisible wall.Environments are very monotone and boring to look at, excluding elements of architecture and sculptures which were made with very impressive detail and are good in general; other than that, every biome is basically the same:Chapter 1 - rocks with grass and trees.Chapter 2 - yellow rocks with sand.Chapter 3 - rocks with snow.Chapter 4 - rocks in caves.Chapter 5 - dark rocks with magma.Chapter 6 - huge uninteresting open area with rocks, grass, some trees and water.I was disappointed with those landscapes because to me, they don't look like the amazing landscapes which are so characteristic for Chinese land that I know of.I finished my first play through in 50h, and I played NG+ for about 17 hours until the end of Chapter 5 to get all remaining achievements I didn't get in my first play through.I experienced few sudden crashes without any apparent reason, and it has to be said that the game is not well optimised. With my 8GB RTX 3060ti and 16GB of RAM and SSD drive there is no way I would be able to play this game in solid 60FPS without using medium settings and Supersampling lowering my resolution down to 60%. But even then, the fans in my PC would work full power all the time.I recommend this game only to those with very strong PCs.",Recommended,2514,67.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

6313,"This game is amazing in almost every aspect. The gameplay and mechanics are refreshing and fun. I ran the game at medium settings, 1440p on an RTX 4060, and consistently got a solid 100 fps. The optimization is well-done.The highlight for me is the combat, which feels fresh. Some bosses in this game adapt to your playstyle. If you find a cheesy way to beat a boss, it won't always work—certain bosses will counter your strategies at every turn and end up giving you a tough challenge. There's plenty of content too, with around 90 bosses, which will likely take 50-70 hours of gameplay. The story is good and interesting, although I found it a bit confusing at first since I wasn’t familiar with ""The Monkey’s Journey to the West."" However, after watching a couple of YouTube videos, everything became clear.Now, for the other side of this game: the difficulty. If you're looking to relax while playing, this is not the game for you—at least, that's how I felt. It truly tests your patience. This game has only one difficulty level. You’ll need to learn enemy moves and counter them, which is rewarding, but if you're aiming to relax, it might feel more frustrating than fun. Personally, I found it traumatizing when i went for the newgame+ mode and eventually stopped playing. Maybe it’s just me—some people love replaying games like this.Overall, it's a solid game with great story and gameplay.",Recommended,1159,62.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

For example, each stance could give a unique light attack instead of just a unique varied combo and heavy attack.But I have to say the game is still very enjoyable on a story level.

6442,"This game is overall, an amazing bit of work. There are some things that could be done better, removal of invisible walls or unification of what has the guide-rails/invisible walls, e.g. Chapters 1 and 2, you can't really fall to your death, chapter 3....The combat is amazing and the bosses are varied. Will this tell you the story of Journey to the West, no, it will confuse you, but there is a part of the narrative there. This game was targeted, I believe, at an audience familiar with the work, with a little more depth than the Japanese TV series, Monkey (AKA Monkey Magic) from 1978, yet I'm still enjoying it, but I suspect that there are those out there doing a little more research, learning more about Sun Wukong.Other than the story and fighting, the visuals are amazing, animations flow the scenery, weapons and armour are all fantastic. Characters and creatures look brilliant and are all supported by amazing audio. Ignoring the music, the atmosphere and combat sounds are excellent, I have yet to notice any glaring flaws, heck, even small ones.Music, normally I mute the music in games after a while, not because it is bad or does not match the gameplay, although that is in fact the reason I started doing it. Yes, I normally do this, but in Wukong, I have the music there, and it is brilliant. I'm just surprised at how good it is, especially when you look at the developer, this is their first major title, and their first game fully released. Oh and I have to say, I absolutely love the Headless Monks songs, that guy needs to get into a studio and record more stuff and upload it,So what else does the game do well, almost everything, but the best one is that the game, and the developers do not pander. They ignore all the DEI stupidity, and even better ignore all the so called ""games journalists"". A lot of western game developers and TV/Movie creators should take note. Make the game/series/movie, don't worry about everything else, not everything needs to be Concord levels of woke (aka broke) ;PWukong (and Space Marine 2), show that making a game and staying true to a vision works better than pandering. Wukong also shows how much ""games journalists"" actually play games or even like them as a medium.Firstly they think that a google translation is absolutely flawless and take it as fact, demand answers for google's incorrect translation. Even when admitting the mistake after thousands of people point out how wrong they are, they, the ""game journalists"" still demand the answers for the now known incorrect translation... What part of journalism is this? Oh yeah, right, i forgot, they all went to the Fox News school of journalism, don't let the facts get in your way just lie through it.Secondly, a lot criticised the game for not having diversity, even though there are humans, monkeys, snakes, turtles, wolves, foxes, frogs..... you get the picture, then they said that there are no women, I would just point out there are in fact women in the game, the first one is shown in a clip in Chapter 2, and you fight one in Chapter 3, never mind Chapters 4,5 and 6. So these ""games journalists"" have not even played the game they are critiquing.Anyways I'm taking my time at this game, so I'm heading back in, and one other thing, there will be points you hate the game, but once you kill that boss you will fall right back in love.Amazing game I look forward to all future Game Science releases, if they keep the standard and sticking to their ethics they have a long and bright future.

Some cheap encounters here and there, but that’s like all other souls-likes, which this game is somewhat like. Overall not too hard, but a nice challenge still.

6459,"I want to start off by saying i am not the most experienced with these exact type of games nor this title outside of internet hype. Understand my experience may not be common and my issues may not be a problem with the core game play. That being said in my first day of playing i feel i have never been more frustrated with a game feeling broken as i have with this game.As beautiful as this game looks every input feels incredibly slow, sometimes just outright does not register the input. And no it is not my controller as it is less than two months old and has no issues with other game and testing, as well as my computer has plenty of performance and does not have issues with other games. I have also considered the possibility of the slow reactions being part of game play mechanics to make things more difficult and while this i'm sure is the case in some scenarios, there are times where movements differ from the inputs i am giving, or even when no action is occurring it takes multiple inputs to make the action happen. I have even had issues getting into menus where i had to press the menu button several times for it to eventually pause the game while nothing is happening. This all maybe be individual bugs i am experiencing, and my issues will probably never be seen.",Not Recommended,1045,12.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

6470,"Genuinely a good game if your looking for another souls like experience for a full price game. The amount of story telling and visual experiences they put into the game is excellent and surpasses other souls like titles imo. Along with all of the gear and the different stance styles and abilities you can use to come close enough to the ""wukong"" experience is refreshing. The amount of world building that you can experience is also superb even though majority of the time there are no choices to make or actual impacts that you can take to change the environment or world. A couple of the complaints I would have is the amount of lag some would experience if your pc isn't up to specs, as well as the amount of invis walls but that comes with the linear, less exploratory areas. Would recommend to anyone who's looking for a decent amount of difficulty to other souls and a ""god of war"" like experience. Journey to the west is one of the greatest stories I've ever read and I'm glad to see that there is a game taking relevance that gives the story more life to others who've never read or experienced it. 10/10",Recommended,910,45.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

6521,"I usually don’t play ""soulslike"" games, but I tried Black Myth: Wukong because it’s not as dark and gothic as others like Elden Ring or Dark Souls. The game’s full ray tracing was a big draw for me, and it didn’t disappoint.I played on an AMD 5800X CPU, 64 GB RAM, NVMe M.2 SSD Samsung 990 Pro, and Nvidia RTX 4080 Super GPU in 4K with DLSS Performance and full ray tracing. The game ran at a mostly stable 60 FPS, using around 12 GB RAM, with 23 GB utilized when I had other apps open.As a newbie to this genre and a mouse-and-keyboard gamer, I found the game challenging at first but got the hang of it. I prefer story games and don’t enjoy repeatedly fighting hard bosses. I got stuck at the end boss of Chapter 2, deleted the game, then returned later and used cheats to progress.The game’s chapters are beautifully made with a variety of enemies and customization options. You can reset skill points anytime, allowing for different loadouts. Unlike other soulslike games, Black Myth: Wukong offers cutscenes and a cinematic experience, which I appreciated. It tells a story with beautiful music, atmosphere, and fantastic visuals, making it enjoyable even for inexperienced players like me.

6578,"Black Myth Wukong – A Clear Contender for Game of the Year 2024Black Myth: Wukong is, without a doubt, one of the most visually stunning and mechanically engaging games to release in 2024. In my view, this game is a clear contender for Game of the Year. Anyone who dismisses it—looking at you, IGN—hasn’t fully experienced the brilliance this game offers. From its deep combat mechanics to its breathtaking visuals and compelling storytelling, Black Myth: Wukong excels on all fronts.I played this game on my RTX 4080 Super, with Cinematic Mode, ray tracing, and frame generation turned on, achieving 4K at 60 FPS. The visuals are truly next-level, showcasing detailed character models and environments that bring the mythical world to life. However, the game is demanding, and in new areas, I encountered some stuttering and frame drops as the game loaded assets. These moments were brief but noticeable. Still, the immersive world and incredible detail made the occasional hiccup worth the wait.The combat offers a great balance of complexity and fluidity, with three primary stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust. I found myself sticking with Smash Stance, which focuses on fast, close-range attacks. The Heavy Attack in Smash Stance, which you can charge while moving, was particularly versatile, allowing me to stay aggressive and adapt during intense battles. The quick strike combos and tactical flexibility make it ideal for both crowd control and taking down tougher foes, keeping combat engaging throughout.Where Black Myth: Wukong truly shines is in its storytelling and world-building. As I progressed through the game, I became fully immersed in the mythical world the developers have created. The end-of-chapter animations were particularly impactful, offering deeper insight into the lore and characters. Bajie’s story, in particular, stood out—his internal conflict between his clumsy, human nature and divine responsibilities made him a fascinating character. These story moments, combined with the game’s phenomenal production quality, drew me in further with each chapter.The game’s achievements aren’t for the faint of heart. The Mantled with Might achievement, which requires obtaining or crafting all armor pieces, is a serious challenge. Some pieces are random drops, while others can be crafted by defeating specific bosses. However, the Bull King Armor Set needs six Bull King Iron Horns, and only four can be acquired per playthrough, making a New Game+ essential. On top of that, the Dark Iron Staff also needs two Iron Horns, requiring you to reach Chapter 5 in NG+ to complete your collection.Another tricky achievement is the Venomous Armguards. During the first fight with the Venom Daoist in Webbed Hollow’s Pool of Shattered Jade, you need to destroy four of his back arms (the top two can’t be destroyed). If you fail, the cutscene that follows removes his arms, locking you out of the achievement. This was a frustrating oversight during my first playthrough, but I managed to unlock it in NG+, which made it all the more satisfying.The game’s production quality is nothing short of exceptional. The orchestral score adds depth to both quiet exploration and intense battles, while the sound effects bring each encounter to life. The voice acting—especially in the original Chinese—adds authenticity and depth to the characters and story, helping the world feel even more immersive. It’s clear that a great deal of care went into every detail of the game’s presentation.In my opinion, Black Myth: Wukong is a clear contender for Game of the Year 2024. Its stunning visuals, intricate combat, and deeply immersive storytelling make it one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had in recent years. While the game is demanding both in terms of hardware and achievements, the overall experience is well worth the effort. If you’re a fan of action RPGs or Chinese mythology, this game should be at the top of your list.

6580,"Great Game but nonetheless flawed.Overall I had a great time with this game. It was great being able to immerse into the Journey to the West lore and see a mythos that is unique and grand in equal measure. With that being said, some times I felt the design of fights and/or sections were questionable and sometimes not fun. As Game Science's first game, it was bound to have issues and, though I hate to compare it to Souls games, some boss fights did not feel as tightly designed as FromSoft bosses.This is a Souls-like through and through, the combat is easier and more forgiving yes, but the overall game design ethos remains. So if you enjoyed FromSoft games, you will probably enjoy this one. But try not to compare it to FromSoft games, try to just enjoy the game and the mechanics for what they are. That way you will probably encounter less frustration than I did because I kept comparing the games.",Recommended,744,33.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 29

In an era where it feels like every game is padded with microtransactions, battle passes, or endless DLC, Wukong stands out as a breath of fresh air. It’s a complete, no-nonsense experience. You get a full game with all the content up front—no add-ons, no extra purchases, just pure gameplay.The challenges are well-balanced, with a difficulty that feels fair, and it’s packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. The story, though simple, captures the essence of Journey to the West—one of my all-time favorite tales—and integrates it perfectly into the gameplay. And honestly, who doesn’t love discovering new layers to a classic like this? The mechanics are smooth, the gameplay is fun, and there’s just enough variety to keep things engaging from start to finish.In a world full of games trying to milk every dollar from you, it’s refreshing to see a studio that respects the player's time and money.

6635,"Atrocious boss design, inaccessible story to outsiders,Every single boss has (almost exclusively) delayed attacks, at least one boss deals GUARANTEED Damage in Cutscenes. I frankly just do not understand the good reviews this game is getting, the bosses are so uniquely bad, it baffles me, I will edit this critique and elaborate further on what I hate about them so much, for now I just wanted to diffuse some of the frustration, I have never written a review but the absolute nonsense they put into these bosses fascinated me and if someone comments skill issue: well I have played almost every major souls game and never complained about the bosses except for prime radahn pre-patch and also every ""skill issue guy"" is a loser and has nothing to contribute to on how bosses should be designed thanks for coming to my ted talk.Elaboration on boss design: (occasinal spoilers be warned)First off, the issue is not difficulty, the time I spent on the average boss in bmw is miniscule compared to the average time a fromsoft boss takes. The issues are:1. Way too many Attacks are delayed, the bosses often contort their bodies in such a comical fashion (yaksha best example), so that they manage the heroic feat of baiting the player into an early dodge to get hit, it is cheap design and worse yet, whenever this happens it completely pulls me out of the experience, it breaks immersion every time, because no mythical creature, no enemy in any possible world would attack like this, the attacks were optimized to fool the player and getting got like that for the millionth time as every souls game nowadays does this is just frustrating. Lies of P had a lot of delayed attacks and some of those attacks were also very frustrating, but on average they took the time to craft the movements of the bosses in such a way, that it seemed plausible for them to move like that, the robotic theme lended itself perfectly to that. In bmw, for most bosses no such effort was made, the bosses stands still, they charge an attack, (with no movement however) and then release, and the exact timing of this release has to be memorized, if you don't want to receive damage, it feels like repairing a power generator in dead by daylight with no visual indicator on when to press the button.2. Defensive play is encouraged, for some bosses I found that the best strategy on how to play, was not to play, as in run around charge your heavy attack button, release, repeat. The final boss of chapter 3 is fought like that and if feels like cheesing, but it also feels like the intended way to beat this boss, as light attacks are almost pointless during his golden phase. Some bosses spam aoe attacks like stone monkey, a lot of bosses have this weird charge back and forth kind of charge-attack that can go on for 30 seconds, where the player can't do anything but watch, wait and dodge and it's more watch and wait than dodge. If you are unlucky, here you just kind of watch and wait, occasionally press a button, it feels like the most boring quick time event, this can go on for, like even a minute, during phases like this, the game feels like you are watching a (♥♥♥♥♥♥) movie with how little you interact with the enemy. These attack patterns force the player into a tedious passitivity. Many attacks, when you get hit do actually trigger a cutscene, during such a scene there is legit nothing to do but hold your no longer erect penis in your hand, wait for it be over, I don't know if it's adhd that makes me hate these scenes, but it completely interrupts the flow of combat.3. The third phase if often more difficult than the first 2 to a ridiculous degree. The final boss of chapter 4 for example just reduces your stamina to an absolute minimum in his final phase because they had no creative, sensible idea on how to make the 3rd phase more difficult, so they panicked, because they want to desperately compete with fromsoftware difficulty-wise and they occassionally manage such a feat by (almost always) lazily restricting movement, suddenly fire is everywhere, a giant tornado that follows you everywhere triggers a minicutscene when one hair of the chosen monkey get sucked in (thank god he does not have a cape) or 1 monkey not difficult, what can we do? Expand his moveset to include more attacks? No, bcs no time, bcs we literally need 100 bosses in this game so 2 monkeys it is. This particular difficulty feels forced, artificial and has no purpose other than frustrating the player, creating an allure of souls-like bcs these games are in trend and it is a meme, but games, using difficulty, insist upon themselves. The ""skill issue"" criticisism has never made sense because the bloodborne dlc bosses, to this day are one of the hardest bosses in rpg gaming and no one has ever complained, bcs despite being more difficult than some newer bosses they were mechanically thought through, fair and fun, it took me several times longer to beat ludwig, maria, orphan, lawrence than any of the most difficult bosses here, but I love the bloodborne dlc and hate this game the issue is how the difficulty is achieved. In bmw the difficulty is often extremely unevenly distributed and lies only within the third phase due to an explosive spike in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and so, it often occured that I struggled for my life but then beat the boss with, like 5 gourds left bcs there was only one attack or one thing that made the fight difficult and when the boss just did not frequently use his nonsense ""I win"" button the fight was easy, so the difficulty becomes arbitrary. Difficulty in souls games, especially the older ones meant something, depressed people report an alleviation of their symptoms as these games had this wholesame underlying message of: ""don't give up, don't go hollow, you can do this"" and as the player tried again and again, they succeeded and this was the point of the difficulty, here it's just... idk, bcs the other games do this so we do too I guess.But wait there's more:4. Lack of creativity in regards to boss design: After playing for a while, the attack patterns begin to rinse and repeat, flying enemies which spam projectiles, 30 scnd long attacks in which the boss runs across the arena, attacks with miniscule telegraphing, etc. They all us the same cheap gimmicks to get you, it becomes so old so fast to see the same thing for the millionth time. The deer boss in chapter 6 is literally a copy of elden ring's deer boss, for this the devs should be ashamed of themselves. They should amend the law somehow, so that stealing like that becomes illegal, I am not even joking.story:1. the story was completely meaningless to me as I haven't read journey to the west. I also haven't read anything in regards to pinocchio but lies of p's story still clicked with me, because they fixated on those philosophical themes, those themes run through the dialogue, but also through the overall design of the game, which creates an overall great atmosphere and the player could actually get to an understanding of what pinocchio was about. I was invested in ""becoming a real boy"" I'm not interested in whatever happens here, the story could be amazing for all intents but I'm not gonna read a book for a game that I don't even like.2. it is also just boring for him to not talk, I was invested in the story for the first cutscene where he talked mad ♥♥♥♥ against the celestial court, but then he just stops, you can argue it makes sense bcs he is not wukong but the destined one, I argue it's boring and another braindead copy of souls-formula.Positive Caveats:The Tiger-Vanguard in the blood-pool and broken shell (endboss) are one of the best bosses in gaming, made me realize I was not crazy and good boss design is actually possible. The many different ways you can counter attacks in this game is unbelievable, so the core gameplay mechanics are great, they are just encased within absolutely horrible boss designs.",Not Recommended,6528,60.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

Most of them you will kill first try and forget about (even those with a cutscene), coz they are so easy. Especially noticable in the beginning chapters.- adding to the previous point, the boss difficulty and quality is extremely inconsistent. Most of the bosses in the game are both easy and have a boring moveset. Then you have some of the end chapter bosses and some secret ones which actually have great movesets and will probably take you a couple if not a few dozen tries.

Incredible cutscenes between chapters and a relatively long game (I did everything, got the secret ending and followed a guide before beating each chapter so i didn't miss anything).Only downsides for me were how the game locks you out of things if you miss something, this made me follow a guide closely instead of enjoying the game on my own terms, bosses shouldn't dissappear when you beat a chapter forcing newgame+. And i do think too much time was spent on creating so many spirit abilities, many wont be used by players. Instead, I would've liked to see a couple more combo moves for each stance, and having the stances unlock throughout the story instead of spending spirits to unlock them.

6691,"I'll be honest. I thought I would love this game, but it fell flat in every single way. And I don't even care about half the problems people are upset with this game for, like invisible walls and no open world. I was happy to chew on a bite-sized linear game. I was even happier to hear it was more of a boss rush, as exploration has started to become overwhelming with the sheer amount of empty open world games on the market. But everything about Black Myth Wukong just seems to be one step to the left and mostly causes me a world of frustration.First there are the levels, they are often large with little interesting happening within them. Every once in a while there will be moments where you witness a beautiful area and think its amazing, but for the most part if you are in the desert, the environment is dull sand and generic rock formations. If you are in the mountains the game is barren snowy fields and- oh would you look at that, generic rock formations. Since the game has no map, it can be really frustrating reaching intersections when everything looks the same. Since I thought this was going to be a more straightforward game it was devastating having to sit at the end of the chapter and look up spots I had missed. I hated aimlessly running around and backtracking over and over again. It is worse when you realize many of these secret or hard to find areas hold important items/hault future progress. I know many souls players will chastise and say this is typical for a souls game but, I don’t think this worked well in Wukong. I thought I was being sold a story rich linear game and that’s simply not the case.Another problem I had was terrible input reading, but I don’t think this is something everyone experiences and I don’t know what causes it. I have talked to many friends who have no problems, and I have talked to many friends who have the same issues- all on similar pc setups. But the bad input is incredibly apparent. I will watch my character stand still and see the buttons I’m pressing LIGHT UP on screen but my character does not react. Sometimes the game feels smooth and great, and other times I feel like I am fighting with the controls.Finally the bosses are an awful combination of no brain pubstomps and frustratingly slow paced epic battles. I was often left confused over my own damage output because within two steps of each other would be a boss that I melted, then a boss I hit for so little I do not even see its health bar move after consecutive attacks. It’s really confusing too because it doesn’t even make sense to backtrack and farm levels in a game like this. It just makes the bosses feel unpolished. Even after you beat one of these more tough enemies it doesn’t even feel satisfying, I’m mostly upset I had to experience such a long, drawn out fight. The move sets of these enemies are never very complex or interesting either, they just hit like trucks or have stages where they can not be damaged at all. It is not fun hitting the same enemy with only 8 moves for 10 minutes. It’s not fun weaving in one hit at a time when you can’t reliably trust in your character to dodge when you want it to, or do a magic attack when you want it to. -but thats back to if you experience bad inputs.All in all, I dropped the game about half-way through because I wasn’t having any fun. I feel really guilty for not finishing such an expensive game, and I feel guilty that I am not enjoying something everyone else seems to love. But this has sadly been my experience. I did really like the first chapter though, it was small and manageable, it had the perfect amount of exploration for me, but it was filled with the “too easy” enemies. The easy enemies were not so much a problem then, I assumed the difficulty of the game would increase over time. And it did, but it also didn’t. Mostly I feel big :c",Not Recommended,3138,31.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

6703,"What’s Your Definition of ""Success""?After spending 113 hours exploring every corner of the game, I’m finally ready to write a review and share my personal opinion on the debut triple-A game by ""Game Science"".In a nutshell, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a wonderful game with a varied combat system, a stunning world, great sound, and captivating characters drawn from Chinese folklore.Now, let’s dive into the details:Story & LoreThe game's roots lie in Chinese folklore, specifically based on the book ""Journey to the West"". Throughout the game, we encounter many characters who appeared in the original story, with their development further explored here. Before ""Black Myth: Wukong"" was released, many expected that we’d play as the real Monkey King, Sun Wukong. However, we actually play as The Destined One, whose mission is to collect the six relics left behind by Wukong. Yet, not everything is as straightforward.GameplayThe combat system is rich with variety, offering a mix of spells, stances, transformations, light and heavy combos, and combined chains of them as well. The game features over 100 bosses, which is an impressive number. Encounters are frequent, leaving little room for rest or boredom. The game is divided into six chapters, each completely distinct from the last.Sound & SoundtrackI highly recommend playing with the original Chinese voice acting. The work done by the voice actors is phenomenal and truly indescribable. The atmospheric music only elevates the experience, adding tension during boss fights and cutscenes.Pros and ConsPros:- Engaging combat with great variety.- A beautiful world filled with secrets to discover.- Deep, mysterious lore and fascinating characters.- Exceptional voice acting and music.- An impressive number and variety of bosses.- Adequate VRAM usageCons:Honestly, I didn’t encounter any major cons while playing, but I can mention a minor issues: invisible walls, broken ""water"" quality settings and awful over sharpening that ruins the overall image quality and can not be disabled (without using UE console). Some areas look explorable, but upon getting closer, you find that you can't proceed.Black Myth: Wukong"" delivers an unforgettable experience, fully immersing you in your own ""Journey to the West"". It makes you feel as if you’re part of Chinese mythology, embarking on an epic adventure from The Destined One to the Monkey King.I would like to express my gratitude to developers for creating this masterpiece and I'm looking forward to a DLC and the future projects",Recommended,2140,116.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

6706,"So I’m voting no for those who are viewing negative reviews to determine whether they want to buy the game or not. And due to my personal opinion being on the fence. My vote will be minuscule anyways, since people are voting positive despite their cons outweighing the pros.Big takeaway:If you walk into this expecting a Souls-like, you will have a horrendous time. It may look like one, but it definitely does not play as one.If you walk into this expecting something like a Chinese version of God of War, you will have a good time. Expect you will just have a long stick and some power ups, and also get stunned from any form of attack, even during those cool power ups.Otherwise it’s f*ing epic if you ignore the combat portion.

6759,"This game definitely has some problems. The things that bother me are:1. There are too many large bosses, and their hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥. Their attacks are ♥♥♥♥, too—it's hard to tell if they're about to attack or just jumping around. Human-like bosses don’t have this issue, tho.2. Some bosses, especially in the later chapters, can dodge your charged heavy attacks, but there's no indication of why. It’s unclear if they’re meant to do that or if it's just random. Some bosses are well-designed, like Erlang, who dodges your heavy attacks and spells when his shield is up. That makes sense. But without clear feedback, it just makes people rage.3. When I turn on ray tracing and set the graphics to the highest quality, the game crashes. I’m using a 4090.4. Chapter 3 feels way too long, while Chapters 5 and 6 are too short.Aside from these issues, the game is nearly perfect:1. The variety in play styles, spells, and transformations is great.2. The story, animations, and music are fantastic.3. Weapons, gear, and potions.4. The graphics are amazing.I’d give it a 9.5/10. If they fix those small issues, it’s a 10/10.

The games mechanics are super fun, the enemy designs are amazing and the art for each chapter is amazing, but as much as I praise the games mechanics it does cause it lose alot of its difficulty. The hardest bosses I fought were all in the early game right before the you get the duplicates, after you unlock the duplicate mechanic bosses tip over like twigs in most fights because of that and the stun spell with those two spells you can clear most boss health bars alone. The game has some sound and frame issues when it first opens, however if you get the chance play this game, if your looking for a way to get into souls likes I would reccomend this game.",Recommended,645,64.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

6773,"If it isn't obvious don't listen to me unless you're aware that you're similar to me after reading this heavily biased review. This is not very objective of a review and I don't talk about performance so rightfully ignore this if you care about those things/I love the cut scenes, the journey to the west settings is very cool, and the art in the game is something I'm a fan of. Lastly for the good things, I don't have any problems personally with the armor crafting, player advancement, trinkets, and character/enemy visual designs, just to name a few things. For me that's where the good elements of the game end though. In my opinion, the combat is only tolerable half of the time or less which is when the enemies allow it to be. I will say though, the player's attacks and abilities, when looked at alone, seem like a fun arsenal. Most of the time the enemies' attacks, and sometimes their movements or placement on the map, are made (this feels like it's by design) to be so infuriating that it does not feel good to beat most enemies/bosses/levels without doing so as perfectly as possible. Hell, I would say that it doesn't even feel ""okay"" after killing a boss or completing a level most of the time. Controversial take here, but I believe that I shouldn't have to play through a level or boss multiple times in attempt to ""learn"" move sets. I think that a noticeable portion of the enemy attacks, whether that be bosses or regular enemies, are badly choreographed (maybe I'm using that word wrong, but I mean that I can't tell how, how fast, or when and attack is coming, sometimes I cant even tell where an attack is coming from.) I personally like games where at least most of the enemies in the game have attacks that, if you're reflexive enough, you can dodge or counter on the first 1-3 attempts. I would rather not sit and have to dodge earlier than I can visually perceive the attacks and fail to dodge the attacks based on bad visual ques over and over again just to learn how early (or late) I need to dodge to not get hit.At first I thought that maybe there were enough redeeming factors in the game since the attacks, placements, and movements of the enemies was by design. I figured that maybe it was for a good reason since it seems intentional, many other people like this game, let me try for myself I said. Then after more time with it, it became a chore and I wanted to gain back my 120GB rather than play the game most of the times that I thought about playing it. So apparently I'm a rare case where someone doesn't enjoy the game play most of the time. And I didn't even talk about the nanite, lumen, and optimization issues, so overall If you're like me just don't buy the game unless its on sale or you don't care about your money.",Not Recommended,2254,17.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

WHAT is that.- the final boss normal and true ending is the WORST designed boss in the entire game, i am so tired of boss steals MCs powers trope. this heavily deducted allot of the points i was gonna give because if they dont care about making a nice ending why should i.8.5/10Verdict: near perfect game with some GLARING issues . hope they can either fix that with patches or take from this for the next game they make",Recommended,1508,65.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

6805,"Genre: Action-Adventure/MythologyThis game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku.I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.- One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen- Incredibly fun combat- Journal entries are so interesting- Cutscenes are amazing- Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses- Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting- Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but on the other hand chapter itself is really interesting- Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses- Having to search the internet for explanation of some characters that are not in the gameJust an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books. This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played and one of my new favorite games, and I felt so overwhelmed when I finished it. I would advise getting true ending, cause it's worth it. If chapters 3 and 6 had a bit better design I would consider this game a masterpiece, but it's really close.",Recommended,6283,104.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

There was a lot of amazing scenery and environments you can’t explore or interact with, which felt like wasted potential and made the game feel a little shorter than expected, physically made the game environment smaller, despite spending 85 hours in my first playthrough farming to level 135+ and completing all side quests...

It looks great (if your PC is good enough to at least handle medium settings), has combat that is easy to pick up and get used to, is oozing with atmosphere and culture, and has plenty of fun boss fights.My personal gripe with the game however is that the level design is severely lacking. You'll either be assailed by invisible walls, or (starting from chapter 2 and getting much worse in chapter 3) areas that are way too big and segmented for their own good. The game desperately needs a map of sorts, as unlike the Souls series, Sekiro or even Lies of P, the levels aren't mostly linear and really don't make it clear as to where you are currently in the area.Also you need a pretty decent PC if you want this game to look even somewhat visually appealing, so please keep that in mind.",Recommended,730,17.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

It can feel like a boss rush at times but I personally like that feeling; if that is something that doesn't sound fun to you, you may want to skip. One of my big critics are the large amount of invisible walls, which is also a compliment to the level design because, there are so many areas where you think you could go but they are blocked off. My second critic is that this game absolutely needed a map system because in some areas (especially Chapter 4) you can easily get lost.All in All I would absolutely recommend this to people who do like Souls Games or Action/Adventure.

Visual direction matches the narrative one and fits the time period amazingly well.Gameplay is smooth, allows for variety and personal touch.I particularly enjoy that the storyline, characters and sound are distinctly Chinese and chinese alone, not diluted with Western influence (even though I technically belong to the ""west"") to be more appealing.This game is uncompromisingly loyal to itself and that's 10/10 in my book.",Recommended,376,39.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 28

6945,"As I write this review, I am currently on Chapter 6 of my second cycle on the game, in New Game+.As someone who grew up as a fan of Journey to the West, this game didn't meet my expectations. It surpassed them, in every way possible. For Game Science's first attempt at a AAA game, this game is absolutely perfect in my opinion. From the entertaining gameplay, to the stunning cutscenes at the end of each chapter, this game is an absolute work of art. You can very clearly tell that this game was made with love and care, and that it wasn't just a cash grab.The world design and visuals in this game are both genuinely beautiful, in fact, I've used photo mode to capture many gorgeous screenshots and put them as my wallpapers. This game has almost 100 different enemy types and 100+ bosses, ensuring that you will never get bored of the combat. Along with that, the many different ways in which you can play the game leaves quite a wide variety of builds which let's everyone find a style that suits them, from the 3 default stances and the fourth secret one to the wide variety of spells which include the many, many different spirits and transformations, the options are truly endless.I will say that this game isn't without its flaws though. However, the flaws in this game are so minor and obscure that they are completely outshined by everything else.Overall I strongly recommend this game to any soulslike, action and adventure rpg, and Journey to the West fan.

All characters are just struggling to live a better life, though it always comes with some sacrifice and the consequence may not be something they expect. This game really has some deep meaning hidden and will make you think and reflect on yourself. I will say, this is a game you really have to play it yourself. Because, overcoming obstacles yourself and reflecting on oneself is something totally different from seeing players streaming online.After finishing the game, i will sometimes just enter the game, listen to some music or watch the animations, it is still entertaining. This game is really good, though there is some flaw about the game play, it is still a 10/10 for me.

6958,It is difficult to write a review about this game because it has so much good things but also some bad ones. The lack of a map and invisible borders makes navigation very hard. The lip sync is terrible in English. There are stutters in the game. Sometimes a strike does not work when locked on to an enemy and misses. The good thing is the level design and the bosses. This game has good fights and nice gameplay. The graphics look great. So a mixed review but after some 50 hours in this game i can only recommend this game because it's a new Chinese studio and it has made a very good first game.

The game still has its own problems, especially the lack of guidance in the final chapter, which makes it unclear what players need to do next to complete the process. But apparently the developers tried to keep the key plot out of the player's sight as much as possible to support multiple rounds of gameplay and the desire to explore.

6992,"Being Ghosted for GOTYFirstly, I’ll start off with calling out Cry Baby Inc. Do not listen to their garbage. This game holds true to Chinese lore and is truly a polished epic. All the hate on this and then seeing the soaring sales and active player counts made me purchase this out of curiosity. Wow was I amazed.You can tell Game Science put a lot of love into this game. It’s not perfect by any means, but this is most certainly Game of the Year in my eyes. It’s sad we have big name reviewers such as IGN being overtaken by DEI boards and working with people like SBI who are purposely uglifying and ruining everything touched out of hatred for gamers and themselves.Now to the game. There’s many positives and a few negatives I will get to. Overall completion took around 70 hours with completing almost everything. All bosses/side quests/secrets.Enjoyed:• The combat system felt very fluid. I didn’t feel any delay and had a lot of fun with all the builds and styles. Straight forward, but takes some practice to really get the hang of counters/perfect dodges etc... I’m usually M&K but played this one on controller. It felt great.• Difficulty was perfect. I like that there’s no difficulty settings, one size fits all approach. Many people compare this to GOW or Elden Rings. I’ve only played Elden Rings so I can’t really compare the two. It has characteristics of Elden Rings but without all the dumb rage mechanics. I stopped playing Elden Rings about 70% through the game just due to all the annoying roadblocks the devs put into the game to annoy you. BMW has difficult bosses, but nothing was unbearable or too grindy. Elden Rings fails at this for casual gamers like me who do not want to spend 3-6 hours on 1 boss or hours finding a boss to only fall through the floor because there’s a hidden hole you can’t see unless you’ve already died to it…. You lose progression and time, it gets annoying, ultimately led to me losing interest in playing. There’s no loss of materials, xp or currency in BMW when dying. I also like how they separate the currency and XP unlike Elden Rings.• You can pause the game.• Crafting and medicines work without being annoying. Have purpose.• Exploration while sometimes felt linear, I was pleasantly excited after chapter 1 as the world opens much more. I never felt lost, never felt like I didn’t know what I needed to do next.• Environment was visually stunning. Very well made, and polished. Great performance on my PC. FPS was not capped. Looked awesome in 4K.• Out of the 70 hours I had 2-3 crashes. I’m on a high-end system and average about 100-120FPS on very high settings.• There were some chapters that didn’t seem as optimized as the earlier ones. Not highly noticeable.• Flying bosses/enemies, the camera will be your hardest obstacle. I felt like this needs some work/adjustment.• Some boss’s ultimate abilities make it very difficult to see. Not sure if this was done on purpose but it can be a bit annoying.•Thank you for producing such a game and listening to the gamers. Game Science did a fantastic job with this, and I will be waiting for more DLC. It would be shameful to skip these games achievements due to a few ugly green haired creatures who are yet again offended.Sincerely,American Gamers",Recommended,2689,93.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 27

7009,"Product received for freeOne Of The Best Games I've Ever PlayedAnother AAA game that isn't plagued with bugs or over-hyped in this decade. Kudos on your hard work game science!initially I thought that bmw's story would be about the story of the journey to the west. But instead it happens after the end of the journey to the west, after tang sanzang and his disciples receive the scriptures. Where after a dispute between him and the celestial court,The original wukong is sealed with his relics scattered everywhere and you, as the destined one (another monkey) have to set out on a journey to retrieve them In hopes of regaining his memories and reviving him.A lot of bosses in the game are also key antagonists and characters in the journey to the west, with a lot of dialogues also referencing the story, which can be confusing for people who does not know the lore of journey to the west. Which I recommend you guys check it out.The combat in this game feels very engaging, with 2 different weapon styles and 3 different stances all with different move sets and attacks makes the game very fresh so you can try out all styles and combine them to your advantage.The bosses can be a bit challenging which takes you a few tries to defeat them. But a good thing about this game is that you can always go somewhere else to level up and farm before coming back to fight, there is also no penalty for dying (unlike souls games) so you don't have to worry about it.The game also looks very good and detailed, with every chapter's map very well made and is also very pretty to look at.Mainly in this game you can craft different weapons and armour sets. They all have a unique passive which can significantly change the playstyle, making this game very unique as you can try a lot of different builds and tackle yaoguais a different way.The main story took around 65 hours for me to beat with all sidequests and bosses. However this really depends on if you want to just get through story or do sidequests and fight every optional boss. It also really depends on how good you are versus bosses and how much you die. For me this is one of my first action games I played and I got stuck in some bosses for hours.If you are looking for 100% completion, be prepared to pour around 100+ hours as you will need at least 2 or 3 playthroughs to achieve that and get all steam achievements.However it is also still fun beating up random bosses after you finish the game in ng+.This game has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time, and is also one of the few games which I bought full price during release that I do not regret buying.

Characters are well thought out as well instead of just big or `super strong because`. Thank you for this game.I'll just write the very few things I had issues with- camera is a problem in tight spaces and when fighting flying/giant enemies.- for the love of god, the multi-stage boss fights are pure cancer since most have intro animations that are unskippable. There are some well done ones that save after each stage but some that force you to go through 4278936 stages before it saves. Why not do all like the boss of chapter 3, something defeatable with a single stage, move on to next with a nice process, save, repeat 2 more times. That didn't feel like a burden unlike the absolute horror of chapter 6 secret boss and that giant bird thing I forgot which chapter it was from. Could you please also chill with the attack patterns of some enemies which are uninterruptable but go on for 192809142 consecutive attacks like the loong prince.

This is not bad by any means, in fact that's probably what many people like about this game.I personally expected the story to be better, maybe expected it to make more sense but currently I don't understand some of the tropes, or the qualities of each character.

7078,"The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated.I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game.",Not Recommended,1769,88.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 27

The game mechanics is simply not meant for me, and as unfortunate as that is,the game wasn't made for someone like me. Overall the game is a 3/5 for me simply because i found the game to be boring.

Love it, its hard, and but its just hared enough. I spent a good hour maybe two on the white noble fight. It kicked my butt. The first boss was tough since you lower level, but you quickly build up and if you grind a few levels first on NPCS resting. Youll find it allot of fun. Got 4 hours in and a few bosses finished.

The graphics are stunning, the combat is difficult, but fair and rewarding to learn.For people looking for an idea on gameplay, I guess it could be called a souls like, but this in my opinion is that this is based off some core mechanics that are used, in the sense of how you heal and having a stamina bar.I feel like the difficultly is close to that of a souls game for sure, but the core mechanics, of fighting, upgrade systems, different weapons, and cut scenes are very similar to that of Spiderman and GOW. If you enjoy souls difficultly with Spiderman/ GOW play style, this game is the game for you.My only real complaint being that audio does not seem to properly line up with the any cut scenes thus far, and this seems to be an issue in either language.

The input latency from FG is negligible in this game, at least I can't tell, but holding a solid 90+ fps on a gsync monitor is amazing.My only two gripes, lack of in-game HDR. Fortunately the Nvidia app HDR works pretty darned good.Second gripe, Steam is lying about the ""native PS5 dualsense controller support"" as usual... it does NOT have native DS support, you must use an emulator like the Steam controller app which emulates an XBOX controller and fortunately the game has in-game remapping for the dualsense buttons (type B in the game settings).I wish Microsoft and Sony would get over each other and quit impeding on the inevitable Dualsense native Windows 10/11 stuff. Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers is the way of the future and anyone with a PS5 knows this.

7158,Summary: This is an electronic waste that borrows Chinese classical literature for hype.It is a mediocre work that is quite suitable for the vast majority of Chinese young people.A game shows the aesthetic fate of young people in a country. They are cynical and eager to be recognized. They live in the dream of collectivism of most Chinese people. Actually this is an extremely mediocre semi-finished electronic waste.

7167,"Rating: 9/10Gameplay (10/10): The dodge mechanics are super satisfying, and there’s a good variety of builds to try out. The bosses are just the right amount of challenging to help you get better without being frustrating.Exploration (9/10): Secret zones are a lot of fun to find! I just wish there were more puzzles or areas to explore. Would've been cool to have more hidden spots.Graphics (10/10): The visuals are absolutely stunning—seriously one of the best-looking games I’ve ever seen. Every little detail is top-notch.World Building (10/10): The world feels really unique, with every zone having its own vibe. It’s such a cool experience, especially with that awesome opening cutscene that pulls you right in.Story (8/10): The cutscenes are great, but the story is delivered in a cryptic way, kinda like Elden Ring. Even after going through all the journals, it’s still hard to piece everything together.Boss Design (10/10): The bosses are fun and not as punishing as Elden Ring. Only a few were annoying, but most were a good time. The Erlang Shen fight was the toughest and definitely my favorite.What could be better: Sometimes the invisible walls take you out of the moment, but it’s a small thing. The story could use a bit more focus to make it easier to follow.PS: The only 10/10 games I've played are TW3 & Elden Ring",Recommended,1110,114.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 27

However, the game still has its issues, mainly, really uneven difficulty with some pretty tough difficulty spikes, which might prove too much for a more casual audience unfamiliar with Souls-like combat. Exploration also feels restricted with really obvious invisible walls and maze-like level design. And finally, the story is a very faithful interpretation of the Journey to the West; however, if you have no knowledge of the Chinese mythology, you will feel lost as the game keeps unveiling new characters, locations, and themes without proper introduction, ultimately making it feel like there is no ""self-contained"" narrative within the game (like in God of War, where the Norse mythology is just a background; you can understand Kratos story without any knowledge of the latter) and that the game is just an overview of the Chinese tale.Still, Wukong is a must-play and a GOTY contender!",Recommended,858,50.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 27

The combat combos are incredibly simple and repetitive. But I like the fact that anybody can pick this up and beat it. It's not Elden Ring - it's much more forgiving - but there are still some bosses in here that will take a few tries.If you have a PC that can handle it - this game looks phenomenal on the highest settings.

7327,"A great middle ground between the ""hardcore"" games like the Soulsborne series and the more standard action-adventure games like God of War. While this game borrows some mechanics from both series, it has more than enough unique ones that it stands apart as its own thing.Everything from the combat animations, spells, enemy and boss designs and lore fragments display the passion and love the developers have for the source material and the game they're making, which is sadly lacking in games these days.",Recommended,423,57.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 26
7328,"Wukong is not merely a fantastic monkey. He is more like a spirit of revolution, which reminds people that there still exists someone who dare to fight against hierarchy, privilege, unjust...for that reason, he is immortal.

7329,"""Reject humanity, go back to monke and BONK!""It's a fun game to play, not as hard and challenging as Souls games except for some minibosses(After getting stronger you can come back and defeat them. I might have struggled because I was a bit stubborn but some of them really felt unfair.). The action is pretty good but both combos and spells lack variety. There are different stances but they only change your heavy attack, so you end up using the same light attack combo throughout the entire game. Some upgrades allow you to modify your light attacks but it's still not enough.Enemies between bosses feel too random and sometimes meaningless. Chapters 5 and 6 seem rushed for the deadline. I like the art style and the graphics are way too good. However, the worst thing about this game is the INVISIBLE WALLS.. there are too many of them and you can't go where you should actually be able to. There might be a better solution for this but it seems the game might have been rushed.In conclusion, the game is fun but doesn't deserve that price.",Recommended,860,72.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 26

7475,"Its a really good game and over the 8ish hours I've played so far I've managed to make it to the end of the second chapter. I am a huge Elden Ring fan and that game got me into the ""souls like"" games. I've heard lots of people say this isn't a souls like but id honestly say its pretty similar to sekiro. Set weapons and character but lots of room for improvement with good skill trees. The graphics are obviously beautiful and overall it is very refreshing to see a game that doesn't have in app purchases or battle passes or anything like that. Just a good game that was released as an actual complete game unlike what some other studios do. My only complaint with the game so far is a very small thing that i didn't even realize would bother me until I started noticing it. That is that as soon as a boss kills you their health bar goes away. This leaves me guessing how low I got them. On paper it seems like a really dumb thing to complain about but I found that I never really check the bosses health while fighting them. Other than that this is a very well rounded game for someone who enjoys the souls style of make your way through enemy infested areas to fight the boss.",Recommended,953,8.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 26

7497,"A near-masterpiece, brilliant game and epic tale, definitely a strong contender for GOTY! 9/10 for meCompetition is definitely weak this year and Black Myth Wukong is truly a welcome change to how AAA games tend to release nowadays: No live service, no 3rd party account requirement and no micro-transaction of ANY kind. You get a great single player game that knows what it's about. I found it to be mostly bug free, none that bothered me anyway. The game looks amazing and the amount of assets modeled for it is staggering, the mo-cap and voice acting are top tier (both in CN and EN), the soundtrack is beautiful and the story is wonderful and confusing in the best way possible. As I had no real knowledge of the rich mythology the game is steeped in, I was truly captivated in just the first Chapter. There are a lot of characters in the game and if you are not familiar with the cultural and religious elements in the game like I am it can be hard to follow motives and understand how everything fits together but exploring the lore is as good as the fighting itself.This is exactly why I would rate Wukong higher than God of War on a story basis as it was all new to me which made it that much more interesting. There are many lessons of morality with a lot of nuance and depth in a really well told and well paced story, except for the final chapter in my opinion. And it is not just a totally fresh setting but also the much higher difficulty that makes the game that much more rewarding. While I did enjoy that, it did too often feel like a boss was either far too challenging or a complete pushover, the progression in GoW is clearly more refined. To put it simply: I struggled a lot more in the first 2 Chapters than in the last 4 and that didn't feel quite right. Some fights also rely on specific items to take most of the challenge out, but the items do require you to explore optional areas with optional bosses. What I liked is how the game often forces you to adapt your build to the boss and there is no one-size-fits-all build that I found as some may be mostly immune to the spell or attack style you are relying too much on. I still don't really get why the early bosses were that tough as I cleared many of the last ones on the first go. As there is no punishment for dying the game is nowhere near as challenging as a souls game; personally I would rate some of the bosses in Chapter 1 as highly as the toughest Valkyries in GoW so it's definitely a challenging game and closer to Sekiro or Souls than GoW difficulty wise so do beware, and try to git gud; I had to.Clearly made by a very passionate and talented team that have a bright future ahead of them. It has an original story that has never been told as a AAA game and the combat combines many gameplay mechanics to create something unique but not unfamiliar. I felt the devs went beyond the standard set by western studios in many respects. It is a high quality product, with a few rough edges, sure, but it in some areas they really went all-out. There are many aspects like the artwork, 3D models and animated cut-scene that truly push the envelop so I hope Black Myth Wukong will be the first of many Chinese titles to succeed as games should when they are this well made.",Recommended,2644,73.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 26

7508,"TL;DR - It's great, if you have decent PC and like 3rd person action adventure games then I suggest you buy it. Gameplay feels like mixture of Nioh, Elden Ring and something unique.What I didn't like (feedback for developers):- Lots of invisible walls - I wish it was more clear where we can and cannot go, because it feels annoying to look at something where it really looks like you can go, but then not being able to- Not being able to switch crafted weapons on fly - for whatever reason when you craft weapons they aren't in your inventory to switch, but instead you have to craft it again whenever you wanna change weapon but at discounted price. This is pretty annoying and confusing as you don't need to do it for armor- - I really wish each stance was a bit more unique where light attack was different, but at the moment only heavy attack is different, which feels a bit dissapointing- - at start of game we are transformed as insect hinting we can use it to explore a bit, but then I don't see anywhere option to transform to insect again, so it's a bit sad",Recommended,868,49.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 26
7509,"Overall a 6.5/10. There's a lot of game here and it's competently put together, but I'm here to tell you the bad stuff. You can read about the good stuff (like the bosses!) everywhere else.The combat:- As long as this game is, somehow there's only one light combo in the entire game. You do get one spear weapon with a slightly different combo as part of a hidden midgame quest, but it gets quickly outclassed even if you do like its combo because it's not upgradable. You also get another spear from the secret true end boss in case you want to put yourself through a NG+. No hold or timing combo variations of any sort. Games from 2005 like God of War and Devil May Cry 3 had more combat variety in the first couple hours than this game has after 50.- In contrast to the lack of light attack variation, you have three stances that all modify the heavy attack. In theory you're supposed to tailor your combat style to the enemy, but in practice all of them take a lot of skill points that are much better put to use buffing up your stats. In addition, they seem fairly useless, as even the basic Smash stance that you get for free is serviceable. Realistically you only really use the heavy attack to 1- or 2-shot basic mobs because the heavy attack is unreliable vs bosses - see the next point.- Enemy hitboxes (the ones where THEY take damage) are OK for the light attack, but completely unreliable for the heavy smash attack - things that look like they connect, frequently and reliably seem to do no damage. And I'm excluding instances where enemies visibly move out of the way or dodge the hit. No issues with your own hitbox - I've never been hit by something that didn't look like it connected.- Basic enemies are extremely uninteresting to fight and tend to die from either a charged attack + 1 light hit, or in one full light combo.- You get a few different spells and transformations to work with, and the game facilitates builds for them. While the transformations are fine, the spells are unfortunately poorly implemented. Your mana doesn't replenish at all except with a couple rare items that restore a very very small amount, which they do at the cost of crippling your healing. This on its own would be fair enough, since that scarcity is something you can balance around. However, the instance you tap the spell button, three things happen: the game puts you in a casting animation, takes your mana, and the spell goes on cooldown. Meaning if you get interrupted at any point before casting is complete, you not only took damage and didn't cast the spell, but you also lost mana that you're not getting back AND the spell is now on cooldown.- Unskippable cutscenes. This includes those at the start of the boss fights, and any boss phase change cutscenes. Suffice to say, the more you struggle with bosses, the more of a problem this will be.The level design:- Each level has pretty much one unchanging colour palette. The green one. The yellow one. The white one. The grey one. And so on. 95% of the environments are one note and uninteresting to look at. Not something you'd notice if you saw some screenshots or just clicked around the progress bar while watching gameplay videos, but the problem starts as soon as the first chapter and doesn't really go away.- The environmental design isn't just artistically bankrupt, it's also functionally bankrupt. The levels, despite looking pretty on a technical level, have no interesting features, and I found myself lost a lot of the time due to how samey everything looks. In many places you can just do a 180 and won't be able to tell that anything's changed. There's very few landmarks to aid navigation, and no map of any sort to help with this problem.- The game won't let you fall off ledges, which I have no particular problem with - until it decides out of nowhere that you're in one of the <1% of areas in the game where ledges are a falling hazard. These instances are only good for a couple surprise deaths and pointless to the extent that I don't see why they're a thing to begin with. The inconsistency is jarring when it happens.- Invisible walls everywhere like they never went out of style. These are ubiquitous and frequently break the immersion. This is further aggravated by the invisible walls massively mismatching the geometry, especially if you have the audacity to want to explore, and are a problem even in some boss arenas whose play spaces don't match the visuals.- Between the above level design issues and the non-boss enemies being uninteresting to fight, the exploration quality is somewhere between mostly boring and aggressively annoying, and on some level I think this game would've been improved by just being a boss rush.This all to say that, aside from the fantastic bosses and the refreshing lack of cringe, preachy or brain-dead writing, the game is mostly amateur hour.Not bad for the developer's first game in this genre, and I look forward to better games from them in the future.",Not Recommended,4104,54.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 26

7519,"Hello there. First time writing a review but imma share my experience rather just saying good or bad. Positive first and Negative later.(Post DLC announcement)Overall the game is a good experience for me, who is a gamer. The graphics are insanely demanding of pc resources, which is typical for an unreal engine 5 game. Despite medium graphics, I actually enjoyed it a lot. The story is good, not comparing to other games cause I feel it’s pointless, rather I could say compare the experience felt playing the game. The visuals and the story are depicted of Chinese culture which is really good and builds up the curiosity to know more about it. Well it’s not a soulslike game but the bosses are pretty fun, and I pushed like NG+3 and it’s getting a bit tough (First playthrough was hard and later NG+ and NG++ were just cheesing through) but yet to experience everything just find out whole rather than going through main routes (hidden bosses and stuff).There are downsides obviously. The game feels awfully short; mind you, I just saw the announcement video day before yesterday where they actually planned to release 13 chapters (approx idk actual but it’s around that and imma purchase dlc fs), end chapter animation, pure art. Just pure art. Love the animation and backstory. Sometimes the game just gets laggy and I have to switch tab and back to game to stop it. There’s no map and exploring from Chapter 3 feels headache cause without walkthroughs (I used from NG+) it’s just circling the same area. Honestly without a map (Yes Sekiro has a map) it feels linear and not much exploration. The story is short and honestly it wasn’t a bit issue for me, cause Elden ring was massive to explore for me.After getting or achieving the true ending, you actually know the reason of the game. I mean there’s no bad ending but it feels incomplete without clearing all the hidden bosses (and the hidden areas are good too). Overall I love the game and I won’t rate cause I can’t but let’s just say it’s in my Top 7 (Cyberpunk 1st obv, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Battlefront II and RDR2). Hoping the new DLC would have new and exciting content, would like to see Wukong’s master and the Jade emperor (ifykyk the actual story).Thanks for reading this.

7545,"Absolutely a wonderful game that any fan of Souls-Likes should feel more than comfortable with.The game has many positives from engaging bosses, amazing world design, fun NPCs, and a very engaging combat system that encourages exploring different play styles and approaches.In terms of difficulty, as a souls-veteran i can absolutely say the game feels like it has a good fun difficulty curve. If games like Elden Ring sit at an 8/10 difficulty rating, I would put this game at a 5 or a 6. Very comfortably for people who both want to just enjoy playing the game without spending hours learning boss moves, but also engaging enough for people who enjoy a challenge. In saying that, there are 3 particular bosses that absolutely approach the challenge of games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls, the final boss, the optional secret boss, and one yellow horned fellow. The latter 2 are excellent bosses that will keep you on your toes constantly with long aggressive combos that will have you sweating.The final boss however is my one major criticism. It possibly is just a skill issue, but I found the boss' moveset to be needlessly frustrating to the point where it was no longer fun. Where the other two major challenges took me around 10 tries each, the final boss took significantly more over several days as I just became frustrated and had to take a break from it. Only the final phase of it, mind you as everything that came before it was a masterclass in boss design that thrilled me to no end.Overall though, that is not nearly enough for me not to recommend this game. I can absolutely see this as the game of the year, and for the first game from a brand new studio in the industry? They have shown themselves to stand among the greats as true challengers to the titans. They have earned my trust and loyalty, and I am looking forward to whatever they have in store for us next.",Recommended,1551,97.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 26

7559,"This if GOTY 2024 for me! The gameplay is refined, and perfectly reflects the story. It's an adventure unlike any other. The artworks, sceneries, and the bosses, all are beautifully laid out.My only complaints are:1. Combat is often just click-click-click, because heavy attacks dont vary based on how you chain them with light attacks.2. Graphical problems. Game should have been more optimised. I've had several places where frame drops would be abysmal, yet I would go to the inventory menu, wait for a few seconds, then resume to get my FPS back. So it has to be a bug.3. The story was brilliant, but I'd have loved to get some recaps about the ""Journey to the West"" instead of assuming that everyone would know the backstory fully. Wherever glimpses of the past are shown, it's shown in such quick flashes that I found it impossible to understand what's going on.

7573,"Can't really recommend this game. I'm 28 hours in and already tiring of it. It feels very repetitive. If you like learning different boss mechanics and fighting a boss over and over until you can anticipate his moves, dodge perfectly, etc. then you will like this game a lot. There is not much more to it than that, although the graphics are very good. Poor/sparse story line, not much thinking or strategy other than learning the boss moves. Immersion is poor due to frequent brief lag and very poor due to the linear nature of the map, meaning that there are a few paths to follow and if you venture off you hit an edge but you can't really see where that edge so you are frequently trying to figure out where you are allowed to go by trial and error (butting up against an invisible wall) which is easily the thing that annoys me the most . It also takes a relatively long time to reload/try again after you have been defeated. It takes a long time to reset you sparks (skill points). It is just very grindy.

All sfx and bgm is good tho truly deserve the AAA title.Story wise just look up on youtube for full version this game tells story bits by bits.

7639,"It’s not often you come across a game that feels like a legend even before it's released, but Black Myth: Wukong is exactly that. This game is a love letter to Journey to the West, and it shows in every mesmerizing frame, every bone-crushing boss fight, and every inch of its lush, mystical world.A World of Myth and WonderFirst, let's talk about the world. Rarely has a game made me feel like I’m walking through a living painting, but Black Myth pulls it off. From serene bamboo forests swaying in the wind to the eerie, mist-covered mountains hiding unspeakable terrors, the environment feels alive and drenched in ancient myth. This isn’t just a game about showing off flashy graphics (though it certainly does that). It’s about atmosphere — about drawing you into a world where gods and monsters roam freely, and danger lurks around every corner.Combat is where Black Myth really comes to life. It’s tough, no doubt about it — a Soulslike through and through. But rather than feeling like a copycat, it takes the formula and infuses it with Sun Wukong’s trickster charm. Wielding the staff feels weighty and precise, but what sets this game apart is the ability to transform into different creatures. Need to dodge a massive boss? Shift into a small insect and flit past unnoticed. Want to overwhelm a group of enemies? Morph into a giant beast and wreak havoc.Every fight feels like a dance, demanding patience and timing, but rewarding you with that oh-so-satisfying moment of victory when a towering demon finally falls at your feet. And those boss fights? They’re the stuff of legend. Each one is a multi-stage epic that makes you feel like you’re dueling a god — and sometimes, you literally are.If Black Myth: Wukong proves anything, it’s that video games can be a form of cultural storytelling on par with films and novels. It takes the ancient Chinese folklore of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and brings it to a modern audience in a way that feels both fresh and timeless.Is it perfect? It’s hard to say yet, but based on what we've seen so far, this could be one of those rare games that transcends its genre — not just a great action RPG, but a cultural milestone.In a sea of predictable releases, Black Myth: Wukong stands tall, a mythical beast all its own.

7647,"An AMAZING Action RPG!The game looks beautiful, the setting is great, and the gameplay feels smooth like butter. The story is great, it really gets you invested to learn more about it, like the background of characters, what the relationship between them is, etc. - the game only got me more excited to learn about the full story and Chinese mythology in general. Yes, the storytelling can be a bit confusing and/or scattered all over the place, especially with some of the end-of-chapter cutscenes, but all the more reason to dive in to find out more about it!While I get the comparison to Soulslike games, it isn’t exactly that. Yes, it borrows elements from Soulslike games, for example the mechanics of bosses, but it does play a lot easier than most Souls games. It’s much more forgiving, especially because of the simple fact that if you die, it’s not really a problem. You just respawn at the latest shrine and you don’t lose any progress or items in that sense.All in all, I loved everything about it and I wish it would’ve been more chapters, but it’s fair enough that they couldn’t realize that with the budget they had. Really looking forward to any DLC that might come in the future. Also, NG+ is highly recommended, as it’s a lot of fun!

7659,"Product received for freeFor the first time, I’m glad that my impatience led me to get this game for free while upgrading my setup. Initially, I didn’t intend to buy it because I had my doubts and reservations, but after two playthroughs (the first taking 65 hours and the second around 16 hours to get all achievements), I can confidently recommend it. However, heed my spoiler-free review if you’re considering purchasing this title.Black Myth: Wukong is essentially a sequel to Journey to the West. While it provides hints and cinematics about what happened in Journey to the West, you can enjoy this game without prior knowledge of its characters (as I did). I was blown away by the variety of characters from Chinese folklore, many of which I had no idea existed.Graphically, the game is stunning. I had to tweak some settings due to occasional screen tearing, but aside from that, it ran smoothly. The only exception was during the final chapter, where the game crashed twice. I’m willing to forgive these crashes and the minimal lags, which were mostly caused by Ray Tracing reloading. From an optimization perspective, it's not a disaster. I recommend checking reviews and comparing other players’ PC specs with your own before buying.The music is excellent. The soundtrack and ambient sounds perfectly complement every part of the world, especially the boss fights. The use of traditional instruments really elevates the experience to another level.One thing that bothered me was the presence of invisible walls. Sometimes, it looked like a path could lead to a secret, but collision would block you. On the other hand, there were sections where you spent an hour platforming, and at the end, you could actually go through. This was a bit immersion-breaking and highlighted the game’s limitations, but it wasn’t enough to seriously detract from my enjoyment.How hard is the game? It depends on your skills. The game provides instructions for what’s used for what, but the general mechanics are borrowed from Souls-like games. I don’t have a better comparison. It’s challenging but doable if you invest time into mastering combos and leveling up your abilities. Even though I’ve 100% completed every Souls game, there were moments where I struggled, sometimes spending two hours on a chapter’s final boss. Was it worth it? Absolutely.After about 81 hours, having unlocked all achievements and discovered every secret, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.",Recommended,2064,81.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

7665,"Product received for freeI find this game to be severely frustrating in the fact that they give you a massive skill tree, but punish you if you don't level the right skills. Boss difficulties are WIDELY inconsistent, with some being pushover bosses and others just being down right ridiculous. Ch. 3 final boss has unavoidable damage cut-scenes as WELL as a gold phase that makes him immune to damage, and AoE attacks that also have a follow-up of a delayed AoE that can kill you really quickly. Jumping is useless. Ch. 4 final boss has the WORST hitbox that I've ever seen (not sure if it was fully patched, as I slogged through it) ch. 5 was a decent chapter. From that, going into a Deer that slows you with chill, takes off half health whenever it feels like it, can summon tornadoes that can easily restrict your movement and kill you. I wanted to like this game, but it seems like another 2014 Lords of the Fallen, and it's pretty trash. I feel like trying to beat it is more-so a chore than fun at this point. I was gifted this game, so I (Thankfully) didn't spend any money on it, but I still feel like I need a refund.",Not Recommended,917,22.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

This is as majestic and encapsulating as the games I mentioned but lore-wise, it's akin to GoW and that game was based on Greek Mythology which is known east to west. The same cannot be said with Journey to the West. Surely Sun Wu Kong is popular in contemporary media, but the novel itself not so. The animations helped tremendously, but did not fully communicate to players the in-game lore. This game is very unlike ER where the overworld lore is new, and so much like Tolkien's world, the lore of ER can be kept cryptic allowing the community to speculate and for the lore to mature over time. Black Myth Wukong should have at least communicated the basic story elements of the Journey to the West novel on which the in-game lore was made. 9.8/10 - the 0.2 being the story-telling.",Recommended,792,68.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end).Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it.

7775,"i wish steam had a neutral optionthis game is high quality, esp because the dev team didn't have much prior games to show for the immense talent they really have. the game design is peak, the graphics are beautiful, and the story so far (i am 5 hours in currently) is followable at best.this game IS a souls-like, but it removes some of the normal things you'd expect such as losing ""souls"" after death. it has a huge focus on bosses, immediately opening with a boss fight akin to some of the souls games.my major turn off is that some of the bosses have insanely cheap tactics that make the game feel hard just out of spite, like hard just to be hard yk? you can learn the patterns of their attacks and eventually learn how to beat them with patience, but i genuinely believe that some attacks are NOT well telegraphed. i'm not referring to rapid fire attacks, it's when the enemy literally hasnt started the animation yet but you get thrown onto the floor and now you're stuck in their combo.i will admit that i havent gotten far, so this review is pretty ignorant, but i do enjoy the game alot. i think that the devs did an amazing job at actually making a game worth $60 with pure talent alone, without relying on dlcs and any other garbage usually thrown into our games. this game has more care put into it then games with massive studios and avoids cutting corners at all costs.if you haven't tried it, play it. if you can't afford it, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH A VIDEO ON IT. this game goes so hard when you play blind. ive not seen a single spoiler for the game and i am enjoying the ride. if you insist on playing but you're broke like me (i got help to pay for it), consider waiting a while for denuvo's license to expire then search the seven seas; but please consider purchasing afterwards if you truely enjoyed it, for once i think the devs deserved it.",Recommended,1513,12.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

7789,"Black Myth: Wukong swings into the soulslike arena with the grace of a kung fu master and the swagger of Goku at the end of any Dragonball Z season. It’s a welcome break from the giant open-world trend, focusing instead on tightly designed levels where every boss fight feels like a thrilling anime duel. The game’s heavy influence from Chinese mythology adds a refreshing twist. Think Dark Souls meets Dragonball Z—with just a dash of Kung Fu Panda thrown in for good measure. It's like playing as Kratos on a caffeine high.The combat is where Wukong shines, giving you a steady and enjoyable sense of progression without throwing you into the usual soulslike meat grinder. The dodging mechanics are fluid and satisfying, and while Wukong doesn’t go full-on masochist like some FromSoft games, the challenge is definitely there, rewarding you for mastering its intricacies. Plus, the dynamic soundtrack cranks up just when you need it, turning every encounter into a heart-pounding, cinematic experience.While some occasional and minor camera quirks disrupt the action on rare instances, the visual spectacle of Wukong more than compensates. Honestly, some of the environments are so stunning, you might want to pause mid-battle just to take it all in. Wukong also serves up a gear system that’s more intuitive and fun than recent God of War outings, keeping the gameplay fresh and with secrets galore. In short, Black Myth: Wukong is the soulslike you didn’t know you needed—fast, thrilling, and just the right amount of over-the-top anime inspired goodness.",Recommended,1308,56.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

The combat is top notch - when you get good at the controls it is VERY satisfying. And I'm still discovering new metas and combat styles now at the end of my first playthrough. The story is created out of a cultural richness that you can feel, and it's so refreshing to see a new culture getting some representation.BMW is not a perfect game, and even though I personally enjoy the challenge, there could be times where it's frustratingly hard. There are some other small inconveniences that you wish the game would take care of for you, but honestly, great work for a Game Science's first major release.

7810,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning game, but beyond its polished exterior, it struggles with frustrating design choices, especially when it comes to boss fights and overall gameplay.First off, the bosses are a complete disaster. Nearly every one of them relies on spammy, overpowered AoE (Area of Effect) abilities that feel more like cheap shots than challenging mechanics. It doesn't matter how skilled you are; if you're within range, you're getting hit. The lack of counterplay is frustrating, and it often feels like the game punishes players unfairly, especially with abilities that stun you endlessly. This leaves you helpless for long stretches of time, completely ruining any sense of rhythm in the combat.The worst offender is one particular boss that actually shrinks your stamina bar to its bare minimum. This makes dodging, attacking, and defending almost impossible. It's not a clever challenge—it's just unfair and makes the encounter feel more like a slog than an achievement when you finally manage to scrape by.The story is another letdown. It’s shallow and nonsensical, with little to no coherence. The characters feel underdeveloped, and the plot seems thrown together, lacking any emotional depth or motivation. At times, it’s hard to even understand what’s happening or why you should care. There's nothing that keeps you engaged or invested in the world, making the experience feel hollow.",Not Recommended,1197,34.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

An incredible joy to watch and play.My money has been well spent on such an awesome game, and I am really looking forward more games like these, where the devs focus more on the gameplay rather than commercial/social stuff. 10/10",Recommended,547,60.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 25
7838,"Style over substance. Rule of cool cranked to overdrive while forgetting to establish any essence.Graphics, audio design, atmosphere, presentation, animations... all of it is 11/10.Gameplay, however, the meat of the game, absolutely sucks. Movement is janky, level design is shallow and full of invisible walls, combat flow is atrocious: bosses and most enemies are extremely hard to read because their attack animations are complete trash, either by going slo-mo in game speed, doing weird AoEs with horrible hitbox or literally jumping in the air and teleporting to the player, it's like gravity becomes 10x times stronger. Either that or they will simply decide to execute an extremely long attack in the air that is laughably easy to dodge while they waste your time because you can't hit them while they are executing it. This isn't instanced stuff, it kills pacing and momentum. Controls are also very unresponsive and inconsistent, I still don't know what exactly configures as a perfect dodge because I just get it by random (the timing is all over the place. Sometimes I press and dodge perfectly and get a normal dodge, sometimes I clearly time the dodge way too early yet I get a perfect dodge). And whoever thought that you should have three different dodge animations, all of them with different i-frames should be fired. Boss design is overall terrible: it's Nioh all over again: melt or be melted. Every single boss fight so far, save for two or three (I'm at chapter 4 by the time I'm writing this), I either get one-shotted by a stupid, poorly telegraphed combo or I destroy the boss with the game's overpowered spells and abilities without consuming a single gourd. I don't feel rewarded or even relieved, I just don't care, I feel apathetic. And don't even get me started on combat variety and skill tree because good Lord is it bad (and pointless).I may update this when I finish the game, but so far it's been a very poor and frustrating experience, it's a 5/10 game at best, with each chapter being worse than the last, it genuinely feels like they gave up on any coherent level design and started throwing random stuff and relying on cheap mechanics and ganking to challenge you (the Pagoda Wheel section was just pure garbage). I hate MTX, I hate pre-order crap, I hate the constant influx of DLCs we get and I hate DEI-infused crap, but just because your game has none of that and has pissed off game ""journalists"" does not make it immune to criticism, so stop with the copium. People love to blabber about how bad toxic positivity is in gaming, but now we're not allowed to criticize this game because it's a ""love labor from Game Science"" or because it's an impressive debut game (it's not, this should be the minimum from a game with this much budget). Lmao, way to be selective and hypocritical guys, keep it up. Maybe if the devs put as much effort into the combat mechanics, level design and gameplay as a whole as they put into the unnecessarily long animation music videos and presentation, this game could've been a GOTY contender. In the end, it's really just a mediocre, forgettable action-adventure game that's continuously brought down by its atrocious gameplay.

FIX it make all other cutscenes skippable... waste less time on unnecessary animationNow the bad things it has problem with PERFORMANCE and quite few crashing for me.. dunno if the problem is with intel or windows plus dx12 ..on dx11 it has weird issues with the visual effects texture pop off etc. or it can be cause streaming at the same time with obs etc but i think i tried it as well without it the first time was playing and still was happening time to time. its the usual sometimes out of memory thing or just black or crash. without the error.. tried few things settings low graphics ,resolution ,dlss etc. doesn't seem working there is times playing for hours no crash and can happen or within 1 h happening couple of times haven't experienced it with any other game having this problem and any of the solutions not working ..plus sometimes with loading or reloading areas or something goes wrong with the pacing and there is few stuttering more obvious visible that it happens from what i noticedthe only thing i haven't tried is completely delete it and reinstall it again, will try few other things to see what works before editing the review about the performance issues",Recommended,1839,70.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

The bosses have cheap attacks, yellowbrow literally has three scenes in his fight and each cutscenes drops your health to 1/4 and there's literally nothing you can do. This is basically on par with lords of the fallen when ever you beat a boss it doesn't feel like an accomplishment the whole game feels more like chore than a fun challenge.

This one is similar, but much more forgiving and way more fun than what I experienced on Elden Ring for the short time that I tried it.

7959,"Black Myth Wukong is a great, but challenging game. The lore is amazing, every boss is different, the graphics are INSANE (do not play if you have low-end or midgrade PC), the music is crazy good. The fighting is very fun and you can respec at anytime to adjust your build if you get walled at a boss. It also takes a lot of inspiration from Dark Souls but is also way more forgiving than Dark Souls. It's a great entry for anyone looking to get into the Souls-like genre. It's not exactly a 1:1 Souls like but a very good introduction into it.The only negatives I can provide for this game, which are more nitpicks:- One of the chapters is is extremely long, the other chapters are not nearly as long, not sure why this is the case, but it just felt too drawn out for me personally- Some bosses have just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hitboxes that make no sense and make some fights just not fun to fight at all- Goes without saying, but the game could use some better optimization- The final chapter doesn't really explain anything to you, just drops you in and says ""good luck!"" (which is fine if you're used to Dark Souls 1 type of gameplay- Repetitive gameplay - you only get your staff and that's it (which is fine for the sake of the story, but I can see where people might get bored of using the same type of weapon the entire game)Overall, some boss fights are fun to learn, while others just use cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you with no skill involved to beat.I give this game a solid 8/10 for those reasons.

Black Myth Wukong is a very interesting game, but I came to give this evaluation a month later, because on September 24, 2024, IGN used improper means to vote in the player community. It is hard for me to believe that within the hour of 5:00-6:00 when Americans are still sleeping, 100,000 people constantly compare Black Myth with the other two games and come to the conclusion that BMW is worse.So I will give my own praise to the Black Myth Wukong（machine translations）我没有给游戏评价的习惯，即使我非常喜欢或者讨厌它。黑神话悟空是一款相当好玩的游戏，但一个月后我才来给出这一个评价，因为2024年9月24日IGN在玩家社区投票使用了不正当的手段，我很难相信在美国人还在睡觉的5:00-6:00一个小时内，会有十万人在黑神话与另两款游戏不断对比出黑神话悟空更差。所以我会把我自己的好评留给黑神话悟空",Recommended,620,111.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 25

7979,"In this game, I experienced movie level visuals, especially the large number of traditional Chinese ancient buildings that amazed and fascinated me. In addition, the diverse and exquisite music, combined with the smooth combat experience, made me fall in love with this game as soon as I touched it. Another major feature of the game is its close relationship with the four famous Chinese novels ""The Western Game"", which contains profound Chinese philosophical ideas. Although I am not Sun Wukong in the game, as a destined person, I still feel a surge of emotions. There are some minor flaws in the game, such as the map, which has caused me some trouble. The later chapters are missing and show traces of rushing work. But this is only the first 3A game produced by Game Science. I believe this is just the beginning, and the official will definitely release DLC later. I also believe that the cultural treasure trove and vast Chinese culture of ""Western Games"" can enable Game Science to produce more high-quality works. What I mean is, I have exposed some of my thoughts on game science. Let's release DLC and sequels quickly. I need high-quality games.

7987,"Black Myth: Wukong is a game that deeply impressed me in various ways. Visually, it is a masterpiece. The setting, inspired by Chinese mythology, is breathtaking, with detailed environments and rich atmospheres that immerse the player in a vivid, magical world. The creature and enemy design is also exceptional, and the protagonist’s shape-shifting abilities make the gameplay dynamic and engaging.The combat system is fluid and varied, with different moves and abilities allowing strategic approaches depending on the enemies faced. However, I found that most of the bosses were quite easy to defeat, both in the first run and in subsequent playthroughs. There are some exceptions—three bosses in particular gave me a real challenge, providing those intense, thrilling moments reminiscent of the best games in the genre. It's a shame the rest of the fights don't match the same level of difficulty, as it would have made the overall experience more balanced and exciting.Despite this, the game remains highly rewarding, thanks to its evocative atmosphere and vibrant world. I'm eagerly awaiting the DLC, as the universe of Black Myth: Wukong is intriguing, and I’m excited to see how it expands and whether it introduces more challenging enemies.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is an experience I would recommend. If the bosses had been more challenging overall, the game would have been nearly perfect.",Recommended,1187,89.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

Also this game is an awesome boss rush and so beautiful in its art style, cinematic cutscenes and story telling. The difficulty is great as well, not easy but not difficult while still dying to bosses 0-10 times. Challenging but manageable if you're focused and check that you haven't missed something. I also love how you can respec your character for free which gives a lot of freedom with trying new things and different combinations. Especially if your playstyle isn't doing well against a certain boss, you can change it.

7989,"Not a perfect game, but a memorable one. At times ridiculously and ruthlessly unforgiving, and at others rather playful and lighthearted. Not quite a souls like, not quite a true action game, it treads a middle ground well with punishing fights and rewarding progression, without many of the brutal elements of games like Elden Ring such as having to fetch your loot from your corpse or risk losing it forever. The lack of a map, quest tracking, and all too often accidentally and unknowingly locking yourself out of side content is a little frustrating, as are the numerous invisible walls that bar entry down seemingly obvious paths. But as their first big budget game, it leaves an impression, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what they develop next.",Recommended,633,82.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

8053,"This not only is GotY material, but also deserves recognition as one of the best (if not THE best) games of the decade.After so much hype surrounding it, I thought Black Myth Wukong was destined to fail. But no, it succeeded and in my opinion is the start of the revolution we so desperately need in the gaming industry. A complete game at launch with almost perfect performance is not something we see a lot nowadays and is much appreciated.About the game:1. The story is complex and retells the story of Journey to the West with a different spin to it. The plot and subtleties are presented in a variety of ways: item descriptions, journals, cutscenes and murals.2. The art is GORGEOUS. I'm not kidding, I think it's the most beautiful game I've ever played. The graphics are amazing but most importantly, the sceneries have a ton of details inspired by chinese geography, religion and mythology. The murals are super well done, the arts in the journal are scroll-ish and the cutscenes... Chef's kiss. The end of each chapter is better than many movies I've seen.3. A perfect ost that contributes to the overall atmosphere.4. Wide (and I mean WIDE) variety of enemies and bosses. This is not your typical reuse of assets with different colors, the monsters and especially the bosses truly feel unique. The combat may get a little repetitive but it never bothered me. I loved mastering the fights to perfect dodge and critical hit my way through.5. Tons of secret areas, bosses and items.The only negative I can think of concerns performance. There were some very few parts with a slight stuttering of the video. It didn't annoy me much, but it happened in 1 or 2 boss fights. Nothing to really complain about though.Anyways. Buy and play the hell out of this game! Wukong was the first game in a WHILE where I really took my time to take it all in and not want to finish. It's truly a work of art and a masterpiece, Game Science deserves our praises.",Recommended,1607,67.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

8061,"As someone who has never even played a souls-like before, and was exclusively a pc gamer, with basically no controller experience, I picked this game up and decided to play with a controller for the full, best immersion experience. And oh boy, this game did NOT disappoint, I remember seeing the first trailer thinking its just one of those chinese games that will look good, but have terrible gameplay or something, and here I am now, addicted to it, i cant't say the game is difficult, sure it has bosses that will make you run back to the arena a number of times, but I wouldn't call them impossible or too difficult, once you get the hang of this game, nothing much changes, except for you, the way you wanna play it as the game does offer quite a few different playstyles, from different stances, to skills, to armour and the way it buffs, nerfs, or changes certain aspects making everything interesting and worth to try.

There were bosses that were just plain easy, bosses that made me walk away and take a break due to anger and frustration, and bosses that were so cheesy that i almost broke my controller lol. But overall this game gets a solid 9.5/10 from me and if your thinking of playing it i highly recommend it cause it is worth the money but be warned it isn't a cake walk and these bosses and even the enemy's will surely beat you down and make you beg for mercy.

8113,"⭐ Graphics and World Design:• Black Myth: Wukong is truly a masterpiece in terms of graphics. From the smallest details like the texture of rocks and leaves to the grandeur of entire landscapes, everything is meticulously crafted. The game is artistically rich with a classical Chinese aesthetic, inspired by myths and legends. The lighting effects, shadows, and vibrant environment create a vast and immersive world, drawing players into stunning vistas ranging from remote villages to towering mountains.• Both the characters and enemies are intricately designed, with each creature and demon having distinctive features, from their appearance to their movement. This level of detail enhances the realism and creativity of the game. The combat effects, especially when you unleash special abilities, offer a visual spectacle akin to high-budget films.⭐ Storyline:• The storyline of Black Myth: Wukong is based on the classic Journey to the West, but it doesn’t simply retell the tale of Sun Wukong. Instead, it expands with new and unexpected elements. Players take on the role of a Destined One, not Sun Wukong, who plays a critical role in this challenging adventure.• The game takes you on a journey to uncover the mysteries of the mythical Chinese world, confronting ancient enemies and terrifying demons. The story is delivered through engaging cutscenes, blending action with fantastical elements, keeping players intrigued about the fate of the main character and the twists to come.⭐ Gameplay:• The gameplay of Black Myth: Wukong is a perfect blend of hack-and-slash action and role-playing elements. As the Destined One, you can wield a variety of abilities, from magic to physical combat, providing a diverse and dynamic combat experience. One of the standout features is the ability to transform into different creatures, each with its own unique skills and fighting style. This allows players to adapt their strategies in battles, offering flexibility and creativity in how they approach challenges.• The boss battles are a highlight of the game. Each boss has its own fighting style, requiring players to learn their patterns and devise tactics accordingly. Combat isn’t just about brute strength; it demands strategy, understanding the enemy’s weaknesses, and smart use of your abilities.⭐ Skill System and Character Development:• The skill and character upgrade system in Black Myth: Wukong is rich and deep. You can customize and upgrade the Destined One to match your preferred playstyle, from enhancing combat abilities to unlocking powerful techniques. The ability to transform into various creatures adds further depth to the gameplay, as each form plays a specific role in combat, whether it’s for strong attacks, defensive support, or magic use.• Players can also find and collect items that boost power, weapons, and combat effectiveness, which incentivizes exploring every corner of the game’s vast world, as you never know what new discoveries lie ahead.⭐ Difficulty and Challenges:• One of the most impressive aspects of Black Myth: Wukong is its level of difficulty. The game does not hold your hand, and it will certainly challenge even seasoned players. The boss battles demand patience, skill, and focus. The combat system is complex, requiring players to time their attacks, dodges, and counters carefully. However, the reward for overcoming these tough enemies is immensely satisfying, driving you to keep pushing forward.⭐ Optimization and Performance:• Black Myth: Wukong excels not only in visuals but also in performance. The game is well-optimized, running smoothly even on mid-range systems. It maintains fluidity even during intense action sequences with heavy visual effects. However, as with any newly released game, there are minor performance issues and bugs that may require future patches, but they don’t significantly detract from the overall experience.⭐ Drawbacks:• While Black Myth: Wukong is an excellent game, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the high difficulty level may not be suitable for everyone, especially newcomers to action RPGs. Some boss fights can be discouraging without patience. Secondly, the in-game tutorials can be lacking in detail, particularly when it comes to explaining the more complex combat mechanics.⭐ Conclusion:• Black Myth: Wukong is an outstanding action RPG, offering a fantastic experience in terms of visuals, sound, and gameplay. While inspired by Journey to the West, the game presents a fresh and creative narrative that will captivate fans of the original story and impress those new to the legend.• From stunning graphics, engaging storytelling, to a challenging and complex combat system, Black Myth: Wukong is undoubtedly one of the must-play games of the year. With upcoming updates and optimizations, it will only get better and more refined.",Recommended,4110,53.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

8120,"Pros:1. Great story - especially if you are familiar with the Journey to the West and the presentation of the story through cutscenes, post chapter animations is fantastic.2. Combat system - Pretty good combat system - easy to get into and some aspects can be hard to master (""looking through"" mechanism). Very rewarding when you finally get it right.3. New Game plus is actually enjoyable. With the right build you mow through bosses and it makes you feel OP.Cons:1. More optimization needed - I played this game on my PC and a PS5. The PS5 version is horrible in terms of performance - massive input lag, grainy visuals. The PC version performs miles better, but still lacks some final optimization. The main concern here are random frame drops that happen, particularly in Chapter 3. It is certainly a minor issue, but it stands out.2. Combat system - Light attacks feel too light on some bosses. Feels unsatisfying, especially when you get staggered with every attack.3. Death by camera - Sometimes, the camera angles, especially for non-humanoid bosses, is terribly up close and you have no sense of which attack is coming your way and when do you dodge.Solid 8/10.

8121,"As China's first AAA game presented to the world by Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong has captivated me with its stunning visual effects, meticulously crafted character animations, profound and restrained narrative style, and its touching storyline, which pays homage to the literary classic Journey to the West. Despite the recent controversies surrounding the game, in my heart, it lives up to the expectations of countless Chinese and international players over the past four years, just like a modern Chinese poem describes: 金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。 (The golden monkey rises, wielding a mighty staff, Clearing the skies of dust and shadows vast.) 今日欢呼孙大圣，只缘妖雾又重来。 (Today we cheer for the Great Sage once more,For the demon mist has returned to our door.)",Recommended,634,72.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

Never gets boring for me compare to typical souls like fighting style jump, dodge, wait, hit, jump, heal....Graphic: Top notch scenery, cut scenes, combat effects from beginning to the end. There's even an ingame photo tool that you can easily make your own shots.Boss designs: There's astounding amount of bosses in this game, too many to be real, and almost non of them are ""re-skin“ each with unique abilities, fighting skills, majority of them are really fun to fight against except 3-4 of them I personally find annoying with weird hitboxes.Length/ Gaming duration: It took me about 36-38 hours to finish and I missed a handful of things yet to discover.Music: Gives me chills from moment to moment.DIVERSITY!!!: Hell yea, there are monsters of following breeds: Snake, wolf, bear, mouse, tiger, loong, boar.... some of them are even in FEMALE form.I will slowly enjoy my new game plus with limited amount of my middle age game time and same time waiting for the DLCs.

8159,"Monkey King's Reign: The Global Impact of 'Black Myth: Wukong'By KAI WOOD|Aug 26,2024Chongqing - Black Myth: Wukong, a Chinese AAA game, has taken the gaming world by storm, smashing sales records and captivating millions of players with its breathtaking combat, stellar production quality, and unforgettable boss fights. Despite some skepticism from Western media outlets like IGN, the game has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from gamers around the globe. To explore what makes this game so special, Bridging News reached out to some Western gamers in China.The New Evolution of Action RPG: 'Black Myth: Wukong'Jacob Kapustinski, a dedicated gamer from Connecticut who is now living in Chongqing, China, shared his thoughts on what makes this game stand out.Jacob's gaming journey began almost as soon as he could hold a controller. ""I've been gaming my entire life,"" he recalls. ""I was sitting on my dad’s lap, controller in hand, by the time I was three."" His move to China seven years ago broadened his gaming interests. ""Moving here, I've started appreciating different gaming styles, especially Chinese RPGs like Black Myth: Wukong."" Jacob’s enthusiasm for the game is evident. ""When the first trailer dropped five years ago, I was hooked. It was clear this game would be something special, and it hasn’t disappointed.""A Game That Lives Up to the HypeIncredible cover art for the new AAA Game Black Myth: Wukong (Photo by Game Science)""This game lives up to every bit of its hype,"" Jacob states. ""It’s visually stunning, with tight controls and an engaging story. It's definitely China’s big entry into the AAA market."" With about 30 hours of gameplay, Jacob is convinced of its impact. ""It’s the new evolution of action RPGs, blending the best elements of Souls-like games with unique Chinese mythology. It’s a game that both challenges and immerses.""To get a sense of the local reaction, Huang HuiJing, a young man in Chongqing, thought of it as a hardcore Chinese gamer. ""Every character has his own story, and it's a deeply Chinese story that is very meaningful to Chinese people. It's amazing. My friends and I, we all love it very much,"" he said before quickly returning to finish his boss fight.Showcasing Chongqing on a Global StageThe UNESCO World Heritage Site Dazu Buddhist Sculptures are brought to the incredible and stunning fantasy world in Black Myth: WuKong (Photo by Game Science)What sets Black Myth: Wukong apart is its deep cultural roots. Set against the backdrop of iconic Chinese locations like Chongqing’s Baoding Mountains and the Dazu Buddhist sculptures, the game weaves real-world beauty into its fantasy. ""It’s fantasy, sure, but it’s so deeply rooted in real places that it makes you appreciate China’s culture and landscapes,"" Jacob explains. ""This game is like a love letter to China. It’s going to make people around the world curious about these places, about Chongqing.""Igniting Conversations and CuriosityBeyond its stunning visuals and engaging gameplay, Black Myth: Wukong is sparking deeper cultural conversations. James Mitchell, a Scottish teacher who lived in Chongqing before moving to the sunny beaches of Sanya, has noticed a shift in how people engage with Chinese mythology. ""The game has spurred a lot of conversations about Chinese mythology,"" he observes. ""My wife, who usually isn’t interested in gaming, is now fully engaged. She explains the mythical creatures and the rich lore behind them. It’s fascinating to see how the game brings these ancient stories to life, resonating with both Chinese and international audiences.""For James, Black Myth: Wukong's impact extends far beyond entertainment. ""It’s a modern platform that not only entertains but also educates,"" he says. The game acts as an eye-opener for many players, offering a glimpse into history and mythology that they might not have explored otherwise.""James is eager to bring these discussions into his classroom. ""I’m looking forward to encouraging students to explore and express their opinions on the game,"" he adds, ""and to delve into the rich cultural heritage it portrays."" This educational potential highlights Black Myth: Wukong's unique role in bridging cultural gaps and promoting a deeper understanding of Chinese mythology.Facing Criticism Head-OnAsmongold, a top YouTube influencer known for his reactions and comments on new games, has heartily endorsed Black Myth: Wukong (Photo from Asmongold)Despite its success, Black Myth: Wukong hasn’t escaped criticism, particularly from Western media. Jacob shrugs off the negativity. ""Critics will always find something to nitpick, but the players love it. That’s what counts."" YouTube personality Asmongold chimed in on the controversy, suggesting that the criticisms from outlets like IGN might stem from commercial motives rather than genuine concern. ""They're more concerned with staying relevant than with what gamers actually want,"" Asmongold argues. ""And gamers want Wukong.""A New Era for Chinese GamingBlack Myth: Wukong, China's first AAA action-adventure game, has broken all records for single-player games already and shows no signs of slowing down (Photo from Game Science)Jacob is excited about what Black Myth: Wukong means for the future. ""China's mostly been known for mobile games, but this changes everything. Now, the world knows that China can produce big, high-quality, culturally rich games. This is just the beginning,"" he emphasizes. ""This game shows that China is in the big leagues now, and it's only going to get better. We’re going to see more great games, a lot more like this, more China-made and Chinese culture games.""Black Myth: Wukong is more than a game; it's a cultural phenomenon, bridging gaps between East and West. As Jacob enthusiastically notes, ""This isn't just about gaming—it's about sharing our stories, our culture, and showing the world what we can do.""Jorah Kai, the author of Kai's Diary, Amos the Amazing, and the soon-to-be-released A Sun Also Rises on Cthulhu, is both a big fan of action games and Chinese culture. Here, he stands on the Great Wall of China, protecting it against monsters and those who would blemish Sun Wukong's great legacy.

The combat is incredibly satisfying especially when fighting bosses with very cool and complex movesets that take a while to register to someone like me who doesn't play these kinds of games too often.

Second pick is final boss... are you serious? Why not 27 stages with multiple clones? That last boss is just too much, it's artificially extending game play time, but for what purpose?

8213,"This is a really hard one for me to review, because when I am able to play the game it's great. While I feel it should've leaned more to the Devil May Cry side of action games then the dark souls, it is still good for what it does. Sadly despite me having a AMD Ryzen 5600G for my CPU and an AMD Raedon 6600XT, the games frames seem to be failing to get to 30, this became really bad when I got to the second zone of the game. After fighting the Bear boss. When I used the recommended settings it always put it on high. And when I did put the settings on low it wouldn't really help. I've had no issues with other games. Elden ring still runs perfectly fine for me, Hi Fi Rush perfectly fine, God of War, perfectly fine. I hope someone can see this and help me if it is on my side but, until then I can't recommend it.",Not Recommended,652,6.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

It's not easy by any means, but not as hard as From Software games. I actually like it a bit better for 2 main reasons so far. One is you don't have to go find your souls when you die like Elden Ring, and two, when you rest, only the weakest enemies respawn, not everything. The graphics are great and the story is pretty epic so far. I love the Chinese culture/theme.",Recommended,416,68.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 24
8398,"An excellent game that gradually unfolds as you progress.At the beginning, it may seem that the main gameplay revolves around bosses, but this is not the case. The developers carefully lead the player from simple to complex, revealing all aspects of the gameplay.The further you progress along the plot, the more extensive and complex the combat system becomes, new opportunities appear.The level design is simple at the beginning, but already in Chapter 3 you can easily skip part of the level and get lost, despite their linearity. But it is pleasant to get lost in such locations. Invisible walls are justified in some places, in some they get in the way, and sometimes you want them to be :)The game has absorbed the best mechanics of various games while maintaining its own style.Despite the variety of bosses, they are all different. The developers give you the opportunity to choose the most convenient build for you in any situation. This allows you to explore locations and fight bosses in different assemblies. For this, special thanks to the system of redistribution of all stats and skills, which does not ask for anything in return.I wish everyone good luck in this immersion into the amazing world of myths and legends of China, especially fans of the Monkey King, who finally received a wonderful interactive embodiment!",Recommended,1114,97.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 24

8480,"Good:-Combat-Presentation-Nothing lost upon death-Chinese/English voice acting-Build respecs/variation-Reasonable difficultyImprovements needed:-Boss hitboxes: some attacks won't register a hit, causing fights to last longer than they should. A recent patch has apparently addressed 1 boss in particular.-Most spirit powers are useless/situational outside of ones that increase DPS potential or overall Defense.-Checkpoints appear to be a staple of souls-like games, but this feels dated. You can miss items on the first playthru if done ""incorrectly"", requiring a 2nd playthru to obtain. A save system would rectify that.-Store items have a limited quantity on things you can buy per region. This can be cumbersome to deal with if you use consumables a lot. It does not refill from my understanding. But later on there is an alternate way to harvest items.

They have one of the best in-game-animations, and wholesome cultural expression from one of four most important novels in Chinese history. It is so fun to see these characters i read about in middle school come to life.As a Chinese International student, this holds dear in my heart to see how well they portrait everything in this game. I hope this game can reach the western globe as a glimpse of our culture, not as a spread of communist propaganda or a threat to their ego by any means lol. 10/10 game for me.操，真他妈牛逼！",Recommended,526,168.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8569,"Minuses:1. making a boss with two health bars and you are doing 10 damage with the maximized attack.as the result, you fight for 10 minutes and then die because the boss did 1 quick as ♥♥♥♥ move that youcan't see.2. during 1-2 chapters I tried to watch cut-scenes, but in the 3-4 chapters it just becomes boring and stupid. of course, lore is more understandable, when you know an original story of the sun wukong, but I don't want to watch a separate film to play the game.3. I like the fact that for defeating end boss of 4th chapter you should kill a main boss in the secret ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ area. Why? Because you need that stupid one needle which allows you to fight fair with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss which removes half of your stamina in the second phase (and of course u r still doing 10 damage) (I was level 70 and I killed him only after using the needle 1st try)4. you charged 3 focus points, you try to do a charged heavy attack, boss touches you, and ♥♥♥♥ off, u should start all over again, you can't keep your 3 focus points that you can charge by stupid small 10-damage attacks (♥♥♥♥ off if u say that there are other ways to charge). It's okay when it's just 1 point that being removed, but all 3?5. recommended hardware for the game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie. you can have rtx 4090, and the game will still lag from time to time.6. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses: dusk, hundred-eye guy, yellow brow (1-3 cut-scenes during the fight and you lose health anyway (yes, 1-3 because you can avoid some of the cut-scenes using specific spell) and the big-ass boss in this stupid biome after white dragon which can only take great damage in the head (once again, you are doing 10 damage on his legs)7. too much bosses: okay, most of them have unique moveset, but you will defeat most of them after 1-2 tries. the real problem is the bosses at the end of each chapter, so you just making a game longer. most of the regular enemies are easy, the game just becomes a boss rush8. you have three stances, but the main difference is the charged attack, usually you still use a small attacks to gain some focus points. well, sometimes the stance is helpful. for example, when boss runs to much, the thrust stance can be useful in such case.9. monkey doesn't use heal when I click it sometimes, I heard this problem from others too.10. if you want to reach every single path in each chapter, it becomes painful. they say the game is linear, it is, but you can easily get lost, since you have 4 different ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ paths when exploring.Pluses:1. graphics (it's lagging but the game looks beautiful)2. u r monkeythe game is still descent souls-like (go ♥♥♥♥ yourself if it's not souls-like in ur opinion), but still it lacks story, better game design and etc.",Not Recommended,2217,34.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 23
8570,"Black Myth offers stunning visuals and exceptional fight mechanics that really shine during the intense boss battles. The game does an excellent job of making each boss feel unique, requiring you to learn their movements, counter them, and ultimately defeat them in satisfying, skill-based encounters. However, outside of these boss fights, the gameplay can feel a bit limited. The levels, while beautiful, are fairly linear, with little to explore beyond defeating minions and leveling up. If you're a fan of challenging boss fights and enjoy the satisfaction of mastering difficult encounters, this game will likely draw you in. It’s tough, but not frustrating enough to make you want to quit. Overall, a solid experience for those who appreciate deep combat mechanics.",Recommended,651,25.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8613,"ForewordI became aware of this game from the trailer back in 2017, and two thoughts immediately crossed my mind: the game will never look this good, and even if it does, every other aspect will be underdeveloped and janky. The gameplay will be repetitive, the dialogues embarrassing, and the story weak. Well, I'm happy to report that I was completely wrong. Much like in Ari Aster's films, where each department is filled with amazing professionals, Black Myth: Wukong feels like a labor of love by true experts.GameplayThe gameplay loop reminded me of God of War and Sekiro combined. While it doesn’t reach Sekiro's difficulty, it still poses a decent challenge toward the end. Don’t expect it to be as hard as the last fight in The Shadow of the Erdtree, though. Most of the time, it's satisfying and offers enough variety in build and playstyle. None of the builds I’ve seen online matched mine, and all of them worked—proof of good balance.GraphicsA lot has been said about the graphics already, and I’d call it the game’s biggest flaw in a technical sense: it’s a resource hog. You’ll need a powerful rig to get playable FPS at high settings. However, the patches seem to do a good job optimizing it for older systems. From what I’ve seen, it runs smoothly on a 3060 at 1080p with decent settings. That said, the game looks absolutely incredible. The developers even scanned actual historic locations in China to incorporate them into the game.StoryThe story might be a hurdle for those unfamiliar with Journey to the West. Thankfully, Chinese YouTubers are doing an excellent job explaining the game’s story for those interested. As someone who only watched the Sun Wukong cartoon as a kid and never read the book—which is apparently not family-friendly and quite hilarious—I’m glad I watched these videos. They make you appreciate the writers' work even more. Every character and enemy has its own dedicated short poem, which shows the attention to detail.PlaythroughMy first playthrough—getting both the regular and the ""secret"" ending while reading all descriptions, looking for secrets, and farming for achievements—took 80 hours. My NG+ run took 18 hours and turned into a no-death run, which is reminiscent of Sekiro and other FromSoft games. To me, that’s brilliant.ConclusionAs far as Game of the Year goes, I don’t believe any other game will come close to Black Myth: Wukong. Game Science should be awarded not only as an amazing top-tier game developer but also as a company that did an incredible job introducing people around the world to Chinese culture.100% recommended.",Recommended,2163,98.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

Set pieces are pretty good to playthrough and the game itself is wonderful to look at although to avoid some of the graphical glitches like messed up shadows and lighting from what I've seen playing on two differently spec'd Pcs.

8648,"I wasn't massively keen on the game to start and mostly was playing it for something to do and justify the money I spent on it. HOWEVER, it has grown on me a lot. The combat is not as good as other souls like games, just because you can die a lot doesn't mean it is a souls game. It is more like GOW or other very narrative based combat games. Again however if you don't know Journey to the West definitely read it, or listen to podcasts and movie versions of it. The story is not very well told and assumes a lot of prior knowledge of the plot.Once you get over that it isn't trying to be Sekiro or GOW it is good and there are some nice challenge bosses. I will mention for anyone who is stuck lots of the bosses are actually puzzles with ridiculous super moves that are meant to be combated with specific items and armour. Fire bosses, there is an anti fire item, weird glowing gold super mode, use a magic needle, insanely high poise and invincibility, there is a hurricane fan to break down their defense. These bosses are not meant to be fought fairly, you are meant to find a trick to beat them.Also look up a guide on how to fight Erlang, it is brutal, if you win your NG+ play through will be about 1/3 of your first because the upgrade you get is so completely and utterly broken.",Recommended,1041,52.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8669,"The plot of this game takes place after Journey to the West and creates a reasonable aftermath. If you have read/watched the original, it is going to resonate with you more. It also explores the paradox of absolute good and evil. Even gods in the high up have their own agenda, emotion and desire while the so-called villains (yaoguai) are capable of cherishing affection and loyalty, may think differently from gods and simply act on what is best for them.Gameplay wise, it is a seamless fusion of linear level design, soulslike combat system and features (e.g. dodge roll, bonfire, healing flask and stamina bar), epic cinematics and even animations in unique style. The last chapter may feel a little bit rushed due to its length. However, the mix of everything does not stop both the storytelling and gameplay of this game from being immersive, smooth and really enjoyable.",Recommended,730,87.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8672,"Bought the game finally! I had been playing Dark Souls remastered for a few weeks before purchasing BMW and frankly, if I hadn't I believe I would have come in totally green, in terms of game play mechanics (not lore wise).BMW, so far, is much more forgiving than some people make it out to be (coming in from DS as mentioned above). I frankly had no issues with the grind to level up and get sparks to develop my build. I was able to find myself invested in the game and enjoying myself doing so.BMW has some very beautiful scenery and score. I am playing by default English voice over. The voice actors really did justice to the characters they embody.I felt very immersed in the story as the hours progressed. The different enemies keep things fresh as they have varying attack patterns and I need to find ways to tackle them. I came to the realization that button smashing won't get the job done, quite early in the game. Instead study their patterns and time my attacks. Do not feel bad for retreating and skirting around the edges until you're ready to launch a full offensive. The fact Game Science made dodging and evading less penalizing is very much appreciated!I would highly recommend playing with a game controller (Xbox or PS or any generic that works) but if you're a tried and tested KB/M veteran then stick to what you're more comfortable with.I have a long way to go but 4 hours in and I'm having a blast!",Recommended,1165,139.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8688,"Absolutely fantastic game. The story is both original and familiar. The graphics are stunning, even when turned down a bit. The combat mechanics are solid; there's a bit of a learning curve, especially the timing windows for ""see-through the enemy,"" I suggest finding enemies with well-telegraphed movesets, close to a shrine, to practice the timing loops. For thrust, the snake soldiers in ch 1 are good. Do your tactical retreat about the time they raise their head.Most boss fights were a lot of fun, even when challenging. There were only about 3-4 fights that were unnecessarily frustrating for various reasons.",Recommended,517,153.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 23
8689,"Overall, Black Myth Wukong is a really good game but with some flaws.Level design: perhaps the major defect of the game. There are too many invisible walls that ruin the exploring experience. During my run, it happened to me several times to be blocked by an invisible wall, while attempting to reach an area that was looking explorable to me. I understand that the maps of the game have a specific structure which is not new to the genre (corridors and some open areas occasionaly) but i believe that in other games (Darksouls, Devil May Cry ect) this structure is best built up. The last chapter (no spoiler) is for me the worst of the entire game. The structure of the map changes but not in a better way.Bosses: there is a great variety of bosses, each with its own moveset but most of them are to easy to defeat in a fight (there are only three bosses that i can consider hard to defeat, no spoiler). In my opinion, this mainly depends on the gameplay and the many abilities and resources at your disposal during a fight. As a gamer, you can find some exploits to make the game more challenging but i usually don't like when difficulty in games mainly depends on the gamer's choices.I'd give it a 8.5/10. It is far from being a perfect game but it i had fun playing it.",Recommended,1039,53.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8725,"在开始之前，首先感谢游科带给了我们广大玩家的一份诚挚的礼物——黑神话悟空，没有辜负玩家们这么多年的期待。鄙人其实并不是严格的动作游戏粉，玩了很多FPS，唯一亲手接触过的动作游戏有且仅有只狼，以及独立游戏Sifu。但出于对西游记、对悟空的喜爱和崇拜，因而有幸在两年前关注到了它。最开始，我对游科并没有很大的指望，不敢想他们是否真的能做出和法环、战神等一般水准的3A大作，直到科隆和杭州线下试玩会。而到现在，两年过的太快了，今年八月二十，居然真的玩到了它，这也是我第一次预购一个游戏，当然还得感谢钱包。（后面可能会有一些剧透）因为没有动作游戏基础，所以一周目我打的比较吃力，以至于最开始还吐槽没有难度设置。打广智，打大头，再到打每一个路过的boss，最后黑熊精。每一章大抵如此，当然还有一些隐藏关卡，隐藏boss。boss很多，还有精彩的人物志，影神图；环境音，boss战背景音，每一章的动画，以及美得至极的地图风景。一周目的七十个小时，我无时不刻都在一种高度紧张和激动的心情下度过。我不能评论它的动作设计，它的打击感，毕竟是个没有经验的小白，但是黑猴，真的给了我很多从未有过的游戏体验，，随着云宫迅音的响起，好像我就在西游的世界里。其实很多boss包括一些剧情，在打之前我就在直播间先看过了，但是自己真正上手了之后才发现参差。视频里看和自己打，还真不一样，这也是游戏的魅力之一吧。现在已经三周目快过完了，现在已经适应了黑神话的难度，感觉其实也并非很难，此外，黑神话着实提起了我对动作游戏的兴趣，有机会试试通关老头环，战神或者黑魂。严格来说，作为中国第一款3A游戏，游科真的做到了，我们香槟党是爽飞了，现在就是期待dlc（早点打上天庭），还有后继的影之刃零等等。黑神话的成功，开辟了中国3A的先路，也打开了中华文化宣传的新思路，相信国产3A一定会打破西方枷锁，在全球游戏市场占据一席之地。是时候做一回天命人，打上凌霄宝殿了！Whatever the western mainstream media says,",Recommended,848,91.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8745,"This game frequently got compared to NIOH/Sekiro/DS/Elden Ring/any other souls-like or sometimes to God of War. If you played this game, you will know that the tempo and gameplay is totally different from all those, the one that give the closest feeling to this is actually wolong.The evasion window in this game is so much more forgiving and you can spam around 3 time evade in a row before a soft-cooldown, seems like the devs are not trying to make this game super hard.PROs:- Gameplay-wise I like how accurate are boss(es) animation to the real hitbox tiggering, unlike elden ring/DS where sometimes the speed of the swing animation differs with the hitbox timing causing a hit when it shouldn't happen. This game's hitbox timing and animation is smooth and intuitive.- OST, story, concepts, arts and animation direction of this game is SO underrated, not many people talk about it, it is GREAT- Some attack avoiding mechanic that all requires a different timing like perfect dodge, resolute-strike i-frame, see through using spear/thrust stance, even repositioning using jump attack or using specific moveset is very satisfying experience rarely found in other gameCONs:- While it is up to everyone how to play the game, many boss(es) can be easily killed with a rinse-repeat well timed bonk using running smash-stance charge.- Invisible walls is necessary to keep player on track on the map especially with how complex they designed the map details, however it does make exploring tedious, can't easily see if that path is jumpable-traversable or not.",Recommended,1304,120.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8788,"Probably one of the best action combat game I played this year. I'm sure there are other reviews that are in depth but this game is extremely polish and well done. As much as it is inspire by souls game, it is NOT a soul game. The best way to describe it is that it is more like God of War 4 and Ragnarok. People who play only the earlier level might think the game is linear but it does open up more and more the further down the story you go. It is akin to Dark Soul 1.There are difficult boss like other souls game but the game is quite generous in giving you tools to make it easier. It can sometime be a bit challenges but nothing too difficult since they give you so much overpower skills to give you a huge advantage in the fight so the game is highly accessible for lazy journalist and bird brains.Of course, if you want make it more difficult, don't use those special abilities.As you can see, I'm 33 hours in and still only on chapter 3. The game is PACK full of contents and secret and it done very well. It is truly game of the year contender. Sadly the false narrative around the developer that was crafted by journalist with malicious intent is going to hurt it chance of winning GoTY this time.",Recommended,976,63.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8809,"I absolutely hate souls like games. I heard this wasnt really a souls like so I gave it a shot. The graphics are excellent. The story is extremely well told, and engaging. The gameplay on the other hand is exactly like dark souls. The attacks are very difficult to dodge, and it doesnt take many hits to die. The restore health mechanic is so slow, that you often die before it even takes effect. The skills are pretty cool. You get a stun that is extremely effective and fun to mix into combat. There are also several transforms to use to change combat up a lot. Even with these things, I just didnt find the combat engaging. They also put an optional boss right in the main path about 20 minutes into the game. The guy is nearly impossible at that early stage of the game. There is no reason anyone would think they could just skip him, but you can. I wanted to like the game, and I played through acts 1 and 2, but it just doesnt get much better (for me). Like all other souls likes they combat is clunky and movement is haphazard. The attacks are at least quick, but trying to avoid arrows, when running out of stamina is annoying. The staff spin mechanic that blocks arrows is super annoying to use, as you move like a snail during it, and have no control over where you go. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone who doesnt like souls games. If you do however this game is for you. I play most games I on hard, or above, so I am familiar with difficult games, so it isnt really a difficulty thing. I personally prefer a more responsive dodge mechanic like Gotham Knights, Horizon, or maybe the Darksiders series. Also stamina is a stupid mechanic in all games imo.",Not Recommended,1354,6.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8812,"I really enjoyed this game. It looks really pretty, and I was not the biggest fan of the combat and raged about it a few times. Once I got used to it around the end of chapter 2 I found the rest of the game to be a breeze though.My first play through where I searched for and fought every boss took about 40 hours, then it took another 15 or so hours of collecting stuff, farming for seeds, and enemy drops to get the rest of the achievements.I ran into very few issues. It crashed once and I had an issue where locking onto enemies made me look straight up, but that was fixed by quitting to the title screen and reloading. Aside from that sometimes the lighting was awful, but it was not unplayable.Overall I would say this game is worth picking up if you can handle the learning curve for combat, but I do not think getting all the achievements is worth it just because of the tedium added by the 30 minute timer on plant respawns bottlenecking farming for seeds.",Recommended,783,56.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8832,"It's a good game, but has a couple glaring problems that does make it frustrating to play. Gameplay is very similar to God of War but has a lot more enemy variety. The game is very flashy: it has great graphics, enemies have really cool attacks, and cinematics are animated (not 3D). The fighting is also well made where it allows the player to play with very strong spells that take very small amount of time to cast so they can still use the tricks of Wukong without breaking the flow of actually hitting and dodging the enemy. A lot of work was put into this game and it's shown by how long it is with new content (variety of enemies and detailed environments).For the problems I had, the worst was the invisible walls. Invisible walls in games are fine if the area that is shown looks blocked off so players don't waste their time, but in Black Myth: Wukong there are so many areas where it is blatantly open and makes you travel there just to find its blocked off. With the amount of secret encounters and areas, it is annoying to have to check every open area, if you don't want to miss content, and find out its an invisible wall. The combat, although can be fun most of the time, feels clunky due to attack animations lingering more than it should be without any animation cancelling when dodging/using varied combos. This makes enemy encounters frustrating when your input for dodge does not go through even when the attack animation seems to have ended. The lack of attacks for the Destined One also makes the game dry where there is only 2 types of light attacks (depending on weapon) and 3 types of heavy attacks with 1 varied combo each. Story is also hard to understand and gives little context, similar to Elden Ring, and I don't think these types of stories where people have to search videos to explain the lore is necessary.Overall, the game is still good and an easy recommendation to those who are interested, as long as they can look over the problems I talked about.",Recommended,1627,47.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

Bosses that have bad hit boxes, cancel moves, exist outside the arena, or become invincible unless you do a sidequest. Enemies that are outside the map or have instant attacks. All of this ruins what could have been a grate game. This game was decent enough even with all that.

It would help with a lot of things instead of just having a travel menu. Many achievements can only be gotten in New Game plus which is a little annoying.

I am now 30 hours in and I can confidently tell you that this game is great, a worthy GOTY contender. It is a new developer from China that produced such an epic game and as gamers, we should support their efforts. This game is good for the gaming industry as a whole.

But. Every single boss after the 2-3 hour mark turns into a Malenia level of fight. You do not design a game around Elden Rings hardest fight by a mile. And these ""developers"" did that. I knew this was going to be bad in 2017 when I seen the original gameplay test released to the public. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. And was 100% Mistaken.

I completely missed the blessed gourd in chapter one and kept playing the game wondering why I could never absorb spirits. There was no indication, no entry in the journal, nothing. I just kept thinking I must not have unlocked it yet, until I eventually searched on google and figured it out. There are key items behind walls you have to break with certain spirits that unlock certain encounter later that you would NEVER EVER find by exploring. The ONLY way to find it organically is by accident if you used that spirit during a fight in the area, or by googling why the encounter in a later chapter isn't triggering.The maps look so samey, there are areas that look completely traversable that are blocked by invisible walls, and areas that look clearly out of bounds that are traversable, leading you to constantly bang your head against invisible walls trying to figure out where you can and can't go. I missed over 2/3 of the chapter 2 map because I thought I would be okay just following the obvious paths, only to look at an interactive map online and realize I had missed about 5 whole areas.Elden ring didn't need a map because the world had enough landmarks and uniqueness to make it hard to get lost. This game has far too many tunnels, similar looking areas, and identical environments that it becomes impossible to ever know where you are. Just completely blindly bashing into invisible wall after invisible wall in hopes that you aren't missing any massive areas or key items. Until they add a map my review will sadly stay negative.",Not Recommended,1686,24.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8930,"Black Myth: Wukong is one of those rare games that leaves a lasting impression, the kind we only get once in a while. The combat, in particular, stands out as some of the most satisfying I’ve ever experienced. But what kind of game is this? At its core, it’s a Soulslike, but it transcends that label by crafting a distinct identity of its own.From the breathtaking environments—so stunning they might inspire you to book a trip to China’s natural wonders—to a soundtrack that’s pure auditory bliss, Black Myth: Wukong offers a fusion of traditional Chinese music with the epic, cinematic soundscapes reminiscent of blockbuster scores. It feels as if Hans Zimmer himself took a deep dive into classical Chinese music culture. The game perfectly captures the essence of cult classic fantasy martial arts films, all while being based on the legendary tale that inspired so many of them.Don’t be fooled by the beauty, though—this isn’t just a digital tourist attraction. The game will push you to your limits with its challenging boss fights (some of them at least). But if you’re into this type of experience, the adrenaline rush from overcoming those obstacles is immensely rewarding.If there’s one flaw to point out, it’s the overuse of invisible walls. While they don’t completely detract from the experience, I would have preferred a different approach in managing the depth and exploration of certain areas.All in all, Black Myth: Wukong has earned a permanent spot in my all-time favorite game collection.",Recommended,1262,83.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

8933,"Yes sir, this game is really good. Has so many original boss fights. Bravo!Combat did feel original. But you've seen bosses like this before with lots of health and the ability to one shot. But what was nice there was so many bosses. I had to look up how to find some of them in a guide.summary (Cons)* Invisible walls* No map (minor con, most zones are so tiny you'll find your way)* Occasional traversal stutter* 1 or 2 bosses have a long run from the spawn back to the fight* Bosses, although original, felt somewhat typical of what you'd see in other action games (huge health pool, resistance to your spells, and can one shot you with a big attack). Also, I'd say 2-3 optional bosses felt like they had small windows for you to attack. I wore out my thumb dodging so muchPros* No corpse runs!!!

8972,"Black Myth: Wukong takes around 35 hours to complete if you do the side quests and explore the secret areas. For what you get, it’s absolutely worth it. I would be very surprised if this game doesn’t win GOTY.The game itself is based on Journey to the West. If you're not familiar with the original tale, you might not fully understand what's going on at first. You're often thrown straight into a chapter without much context. It's only at the end of each chapter, through a short anime-style cutscene with a narrator, that you receive some backstory and start piecing things together. These cutscenes help explain the events that just transpired, but during the gameplay cutscenes, you may find yourself wondering why certain things are happening.The combat throughout the game is exactly what you'd expect from an action RPG. The gameplay is agile and versatile, feeling quite similar to Souls games like Sekiro. However, you make more use of individual magic skills and dodging. Depending on your chosen playstyle, certain areas and bosses can feel very different.The side quests in this game also remind me of the Souls series. Some NPCs feel so disconnected from the world that you might talk to them once and just move on, as their importance isn't immediately clear. But, as with any of the original Souls games, every small detail is connected to something else, often in ways you wouldn’t think of.One issue is the invisible walls. It feels like the developers designed these beautiful levels but struggled with how to limit where you can go. If they put stone walls or barriers everywhere, it would ruin the aesthetic. Still, I think they could’ve handled it better—if I jump off a cliff, just let me fall and die rather than hitting an invisible barrier. It breaks immersion and can be frustrating at times.As for performance, the game runs well on my PC, with only a few instances of major frame drops due to a lot of things happening on screen. The game also crashed once, just two hours before the ending.Other than that, it's probably the best game I’ve played this year.Played on: RTX 4080, Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 2560x1440",Recommended,1770,31.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

BUT I felt the pure PLEASURE of experiencing a great history, facing different challenges -- the pure pleasure of gaming.And as a Chinese player, I still remember these years when I needed to refer to a Japanese dictionary to play a PS1/2 game without Chinese localisation.

Many abilities to unlock.Fights will suck you in and put you into a rhythmic trance, numerous mechanics give you a solid stream of dopamine release during the fight.

9015,"This has got to be the most fun I've had in a new game in a really long time. That being said, let's just get what I didn't like out of the way first, because I think this game deserves to hear it's praises mostly.I found the game to be quite demanding on my computer, and that's no problem. I run most games on the highest settings, but for a frame rate that I could enjoy I ended up putting the settings on medium. This made some particle effects such as the cloud you ride on at the end of the game noticeably unpleasant to look at, so I'm not sure if I just need to upgrade mt GPU or if the game could have used a tad bit more optimization. HOWEVER - the game was still absolutely stunning to look at and I have no complaints about the actual visuals, which were immaculate.I really didn't like level 2 as a whole, I found that the map was far too open for my taste and the secret questline to be far too vague, leading to an item that made the final boss of the area much more enjoyable to fight. I think locking a seemingly intended item behind such a vague questline that doesn't offer you much more than mindlessly wandering around until you stumble across where you need to go in such a large, open map to not be very much fun.I had the game crash a few times and I have no clue what could have caused it, but reopening the game was fine because the auto-save feature works so well that it made this nearly a non-issue.I wish that there were ways to turn off certain attacks - such as how most of the time I wasn't too interested in using varied combos, and just enjoyed learning to perfect dodge and parry everything. Wanting to use my charged attack strictly as a small heal made me kind of do some silly things to not cause a varied combo input.Now the good!I LOVED THE GAME SO MUCH! I dearly hope that this wins game of the year, I think it genuinely deserves it.I adored the setting, visuals, characters, combat, exploration (Minus the second level), mini bosses, and secret areas. I haven't felt this kind of adventure in so long, and it coming from a Chinese developer makes me so happy to see that country hopping into the AAA market and doing it better than the western developers!I really cannot sing this games praises enough, the game is just simply fun. It is so, so fun. Learning the story of Wukong through these means was an absolute pleasure, and getting to experience the phenomenal Chinese mythology through a great medium was just a blast.I'm very glad to see this game do so well and I hope that it inspires more developers to make more games like it, potentially not always in European fantasy, as there are so many more great cultures to pull from.",Recommended,2176,42.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

I can see why it's a Game of the Year contender for some. I'm happy to have bought this game, will play the DLC for sure! My experience overall exceeded my expectations.I didn't really like the game the first 1-2 hours because I was not used to a game having no mini-map and only be about fighting small mobs/ big bosses alternatively but I really grew to like it. I can really see why there is a fan base behind this style.This game stems from ""Journey to the west"" Chinese mythology (which I haven't read AND is not explained).Nevertheless, don't worry the game has some really cool art style and dialogues that makes you still enjoy it (makes you curious and read about the book actually which was my case).Cutscenes are great. Surprisingly great cinematography (loved the animations).Dodge mechanism still extremely satisfying after 80h+ !Bosses are well designed, and 10 or so actually give you a challenge to think about. Never got stuck too long so don't fear it being frustratingly difficult.Character movement and skillsets are truly fun (suits any play style I can think of). I also like that the character is mute (so I can have my own thoughts following a situation).Graphics are very nice (I played on ""high"" settings in general)Music very pleasant and culturally immersive.Oh and one last thing that needs to be said nowadays sadly: after 80h+ played I only encountered 3 minor bugs, great lunch, enough said!",Recommended,1353,93.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

9070,"Thank you, Game Science, for creating Black Myth: Wukong. I’ve been playing games since the days of Gameboy and Super Nintendo, and I don’t usually write reviews on Steam, but this game has truly reignited that sense of wonder I used to feel when playing new titles on the PS2 and PS3—when the only time we saw cutting-edge graphics was in the cinematic cutscenes.From the moment I stepped into this world, I felt a level of immersion I’ve been waiting for in a game. Sure, comparisons to God of War or Dark Souls are inevitable, and while I can see those influences, Black Myth: Wukong feels like a completely distinct experience. This game will stand as an original piece of work, one that others will undoubtedly try to emulate in the future. The story is remarkable, hooking me from the start. I was particularly captivated by the stop-motion cutscene with the white fox, which added such a distinct visual flair, and the animations throughout were nothing short of stunning.The gameplay is masterfully done, with flawless combat mechanics and skill progression that keeps things fresh. The customization options—whether it's distributing skill points or experimenting with different spirits—ensure that every fight feels dynamic, keeping repetition at bay. The difficulty balance is great too; up until the Yellow Wind Sage, I thought I had a handle on things. But when I finally defeated him, it was an exhilarating challenge that left me feeling like a king. That’s what makes this game so special: the ability to make every victory feel earned and rewarding.This is a title that deserves all the accolades it’s bound to receive. I genuinely believe Black Myth: Wukong is a Game of the Year contender. Hats off to the team. 10/10, and I can’t wait to see what you do next.",Recommended,1479,2.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

9079,"‣ 9.5/10 – Made in China, but it’s good.‣ Thoughts: Mmmmm monkeyyyy.I’m honestly surprised that Big C allowed this game to flourish and be released worldwide. With all of its rules and limitations it’s truly a miracle the game exists.Recently new Asian gaming companies have been cooking up some real bangers in the souls-like genre. First, we had Lies of P that resembled Bloodborne with a whacky twist and now comes Black Myth: Wukong that feels like a really creative spin on the new God of War formula. I call this game a souls-like so people get an idea what type of game this is, but in reality, Black Myth manages to become unique and memorable in its own way. Only a handful of times did I point at my screen like Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood screaming: “This is just like Dark Souls”, which is a good thing. Clearly the game is inspired by these other titles and yet it still feels very distinct.By far the biggest surprise to me was the games scale. In just 6 years these developers created a 5-chapter thick experience with over 90 unique enemies and half as much boss fights. Not to mention most of them become usable spells etc. Here, the combat has tons of variety, different stances you can utilize and combinations to try without any real commitment. It seems like these people knew exactly what systems and features make players happy and just gave us the best variations of it. I think one of the main reasons combat here feels so good is because of its well-done animation work. Each enemy is really well telegraphed and clearly animated. Not once did I feel like I was hit by nothing or couldn’t explain why a dodge failed. Granted, the longer you play Black Myth the more you notice repeating patterns in enemy attacks. For example, many enemies like to scream as loud as possible creating a damaging aoe attack. Others prefer to charge at you 3 times consistently which can get repetitive and boring in later chapters. However, the complete package here is so tasty that the side dishes don’t really matter that much.Overall, China has cooked up a fantastic game. Just the secret ending alone deserves an extra point if I’m being honest. The game looks beautiful, has a lot of features that intertwine flawlessly and keeps up a great pace for its length. I hope we get more games like this in the feature.",Recommended,1931,47.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 23

This game pays so much respect and homage to the original source material in its characters and setting, it's honestly mind blowing how well realized the set pieces are. If you're not familiar with the original lore, the story might seem incoherent but still somewhat understandable.As for the gameplay side of things, it's less of a soulslike and more of just an action combat game with some souls elements. The enemy variety is insane, every chapter has a new set of enemies that pertains to the biome. The game is quite linear with some branching pathways for exploration but for the most part, it's quite simple. I see this as a boss rush game like Megaman.I urge anyone who enjoys fighting difficult (but fair) bosses in video games to try out this game.

This is grand and this is epic. Such greatness and excellence. Characters, music, the world, and its stories.Journey to the West is the kind of tale that moves the mountains and buries the sun.Never did I experience such an ambitious, incredible, and jaw-dropping adventure. It's so touching that I cannot help but feel like a piece of me is missing now that I finished the game.The stakes are heaven and earth themselves but also are nothing more than you, than me, an individual, and their inner spirit. They are global and far-reaching, yet so private.On a chessboard where the the pieces are the players, and the players are ever perplexed whether they are destiny's pawns or each is the result of their own doing.Are we mere instruments for the Celestial court, for those high above? or are we truly a monkey reaps what he sows?This journey is so magnificent and well-written that it makes you wish to be Chinese. That you were there in the 1600s. That you were with the journeyers, for I wished that... and since wishes aren't horses, to that end, I bid all of you farewell at this moment, for our journey is unfinished and we shall all meet in the novel.",Recommended,1143,69.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9155,"Product received for freeBlack Myth: Wukong delivers on almost every expectation, offering an engaging and immersive experience. The story is rich and at times a bit complex, but the intricate plot is balanced by stunning short animated films at the end of each chapter. These cinematic scenes focus on the final bosses or delve deeper into the lore, bringing the Journey to the West mythos to life in a creative way. The characters are memorable and unique, each with distinct designs and attack patterns, making encounters feel fresh. A standout is Bajie, one of the best sidekicks in recent games.That said, the game does have its flaws. The use of invisible walls is noticeable—while they can add to the aesthetics, in some areas they feel too restrictive, forcing linear paths in otherwise open environments. I also encountered a few minor bugs, though nothing **** gameplay itself is fantastic, with a high degree of replayability thanks to the wide variety of weapons, skills, effects, and passives to experiment with. The boss designs are some of the best I've seen, adding challenge and excitement in ways that are both tough and, at times, surprisingly easy. In a time where there are fewer games that strike this balance, Black Myth: Wukong stands out in 2024 as a much-needed addition to the action genre.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys challenging games with dynamic combat and epic boss battles.I'd give it a 9/10",Recommended,1199,41.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

( immobilize one example.) game difficulty not the issue just doesnt jiv well on action transitions.jump also decides when it wants to work or not.",Not Recommended,545,34.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9177,"I have a hard time to decide between this and final fantasy 7 for who is the game of the year. I remember that when this game was first teased a couple of years ago , many people were extremely suspicions , saying that this game is impossible to be made. Now that we have this game finally here, i can only say that i'm impressed with everything . The combat is amazing , the graphics are next gen, the main character is memorable and unique , the bosses are hard but fair and the design is top noch . 10/10 game .",Recommended,412,0.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 22
9178,"Ok so, i will start by saying that i like this game... BUT there are many things i dont like/enjoy about it. I will try to give an honest review from my pov of this game because i feel like i at least got baited by the hype train on this game.for now at least i am halfway through with chapter 2 and i will talk about all the pros and cons i ve met so far.Pros:-game is pretty fun and enjoyable-i like the visuals and sound designs a lot-combat is satisfying-some bosses feel really cool-really cool scenery and backgrounds. by this i mean that the maps look really good visual design wiseCons:-game is pretty hardware demanding-the combat gets a bit repetitive-the level design is honestly GARBAGE. In chapter 2 u get at every big checkpoint around 4 path options which makes the progression extremly hard to track, confusing and honestly frustrating/annoying.-the fact that if u attack an enemy that is near a ledge that u can drop off from u are 90% gonna fall-the camera lock system is pretty bad-the game feels a bit like a boss rush . u just get boss after boss after a long ass path filled with mobs and than more bosses.-the game doesnt really give u clues about begining a boss fight u just happen to get in them completly unprepared without mana and heals-there are quite a lot of bosses in this game with bs hitboxes/animations or aoe attacks that will literarly almost 1shot u-there are a few annoying bugs(might not apply to you) but for me sometimes when i go in the main menu of the game the screen bugs out and feels slugish and flickers wierdly and i have to just alt tab to get this fixed but gets annoying after a whileWith this being said i dont really feel like this game is necessarly hard. If u get stuck on a boss u can just farm a bit of xp or amterials to get a better armour and get it over with, most of the bosses so far(reminder im still in chap2) i beat 2nd try because the game just threw a random boss at me and i went in quite unprepared(no heals or mana). I felt the need to write this review because as i ve told before i felt like i got really baited by the hype train of this game. I dont regret buying this game but IT IS NOT A MASTERPIECE. It has a lot of room for improvement but also a lot of potential. I do feel like this is one of the better game that came out this year tho.",Not Recommended,1874,12.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 22
9179,"*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*SERIOUSLY, OMFingG...*WARNING!!!*ARACHNOPHOBIA ULTRA-OVERLOAD WARNING!This has, undoubtedly, the most extreme example I've ever seen in ANY media, EVER.There NEEDS to be a HEAVY DISCLAIMER for this, in BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINED, 200 point font on the FRONT F***ING PAGE of the store, as there is an EXTENSIVE section that CANNOT BE SKIPPED, and no arachnophobia settings to speak of WHATSOEVER. If you have this fear, I am sorry, this will likely be literally unplayable for you upon reaching the 4th chapter. I don't particularly like spiders myself, and even if you LOVE them, this will certainly test your mettle in that regard.Aside from that...What an absolute triumph. The amount of detail, passion, style, and substance in this game is unprecedented. Just play it for yourself, even if you don't know diddly about Journey to the West, like me...It does take some getting used to, though, if you're coming off of Souls-likes. There's a lot to keep track of, and combat almost feels unresponsive until you get a feel for it. It's more akin to Jedi Survivor or God of War than anything from From Software. Hitboxes are more forgiving (sometimes), but you will still die to some bulls**t, I promise. Thought Consort Radahn's combos were a bit much? Well, Game Science said, ""Hold my Baijiu...""Fast-paced and rewarding, engaging and gorgeous, I would highly recommend this, especially on an enthusiast rig. I haven't crashed a single time in 4 chapters. It's been buttery smooth for the most part with only a few hiccups on max settings with ray tracing. 4070, 10900k, 64g RAM, SSD.My only real complaint would be with all the invisible walls.

9199,"Your enjoyment of this game heavily relies on your knowledge of the source material or tolerance for soulslike games. I meet neither requirement so for a majority of the 50h I played, I did not have a good time. I was expecting a retelling of the Journey in game format, instead it's an OC sequel to a novel I never read and doesn't even progress the story all that much beyond what is already known.Story wise you meet and fight back to back bosses nearly constantly with no context as to why they want you dead and they don't even say anything besides ""En garde!"" before assaulting you.Gameplay is decent enough to keep you engaged throughout but again the boss rush will sour your playthrough as many of these bosses heavily rely on cheap gimmicks to trip you up during fights like delayed attacks, phase changes where they float in the air for almost a full minute or grabs that instantly shreds half of your HP.The worst offender was Chapter 3, being the longest and a genuine chore to get through as it was the length of both previous chapters combined in total and the final boss had two phase transitions that are cutscenes where you take unavoidable half HP damage and a gold form where he's immune to your basic attacks.While fighting him and searching for tips online I also found out that every boss can input read you charging up for a heavy attack and will back away or dash into you when you start doing so.. Absolutely horrendous and unfair design imo but little irritating tricks like these exist in all of the others to artificially inflate difficulty and force you to die again and again until you ""get good"" like the average soulslike masochist would say.I forced myself to the end waiting to see how long it takes to get good and to my surprise it did, near the end. The secret final boss as well as the final boss himself were beautifully crafted and fairly challenging without relying on the previous gimmicks other bosses would pull. Unfortunately this came at around 40h in my playthrough.In the end I do regret getting roped into the hype train and paying full price for this. I think I'd have been happier with a 30€ price tag a couple months down the line. This is not the end all be all of gaming some people are acting like it is. It just happens to be a decent 7/10 game not plagued by the usual forced agendas we're tired of hearing about.As stated in the beginning, you can disregard this review if you read and enjoy the novel and are a fan of Soulslikes because this absolutely is one despite people trying to trick newcomers into believing it's not.",Not Recommended,2117,48.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9219,"Black Myth: Wukong has been an amazing journey! I enjoyed the gameplay, sound design, music, characters, and the fantastic world-building as well as the many references to the books too. One of my favorite features are the incredible music videos that play after finishing each chapter, adding a unique touch to the experience before laying the chapter to rest. Even the enemy AI was quite impressive and stuck the most with me with the animations. Though the English dub was not synced properly with the lips of speaking characters which makes me recommend the amazing Chinese Dub of the game.While there were a few minor issues, they’re mostly nit-picky. For instance, I found that some paths lacked clarity. I like to complete all side objectives before progressing the main story/path, but more than once, I accidentally stumbled onto the main path. Maybe I missed a subtle hint or something that was explained inside the game itself, but it was frustrating to unexpectedly trigger a boss fight and then be forced into the next chapter. Unfortunately, once this happens, there’s no way to go back without starting the new chapter and using the shrine to return to the previous Chapter.Aside from that small nit-pick, Black Myth: Wukong is undoubtedly my game of the year. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-packed, immersive gaming experiences as well as the fans that enjoyed the books and many forms medias adapted from it such as Dragon Ball and etc!",Recommended,1223,90.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

Especially on high settings and 4k resolution, I was sometimes stunned at the graphical beauty of it- The soundtrack is super well done. The chinese songs in chapter 2 were absolute bangers and overall everything fit really well- The story, although quite confusing, overall was investing. Even though I did have to do some seperate research, I think I got the gist of everything- The amount of content in this game, especially secret content is wild and makes it so worth exploring aroundCons:- This game often lacks a sense of direction. This first became apparent to me in chapter 2 and 3 where there are so many branching paths, I started to feel overwhelmed. Eventually it resolved itself through the paths linking but I still wasn't a big fan.- The lack of direction is especially prevalent in chapter 6. Getting the was something I was very excited for, but it was made so boring by the lack of music and dynamics while using it. It's super slow and with chapter 6 just being a huge open area that you're tossed into with no indicator where to go, it was definitely a blunder.- This game sometimes feels very clunky and unpolished. Sometimes enemy attacks are so ridiculously unfair that they should not be in a final game. When it's just artificial difficulty and not actual difficulty, it should not be in the game.Overall: 8/10",Recommended,1398,50.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

I'm happy this game has experienced a lot of success and I look forward to potential DLC with rumours that the game was originally going to have 11 (not 6) chapters and that there is a possibility the missing 5 could be divided up into DLC releases which I would definitely be interested in checking out.",Recommended,918,72.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

It requires more refinement to surpass the level of a real AAA game such as Elden Ring and Sekiro.The main drawback of this game is that it doesn't have a map and there are invisible air-wall everywhere. It can be quite frustrating when exploring. Majority of small enemies are dumb. Though most bosses fights aren't bad, but lack immediate and intense interaction.Personally, I would give a score of 7 to 7.5 out of 10 (Sekiro and Darksoul3 are 9 and 8.5 for me).",Not Recommended,491,191.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

Half there movesets will be off screen so there is no ability to read and react to the move.-No mechanics to alter the way you fight other than beat bad guy with stick in the exact same 5 move combo which it gets boring quick not to mention provides no versatility to the way you can play.Overall it is a beautiful game but making beautiful turd is still a turd.,Not Recommended,613,9.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9355,"Before I begin, I should state that I was looking forward to this game and pretty hyped for it, and even though I would not recommend this game, I don't think that it is a bad game overall. I have several hours in at this point and I will be playing it to the end and trying to get all the achievements. However, I am disappointed with the game as of now.This game is absolutely beautiful, truly a next gen game, however that can also be a hindrance at times. At times it gets hard to figure out where you need to go because the lighting and shadows can obfuscate the path. Add in all the invisible walls and sometimes it may seem like you should be able to get to certain places, or that the game wants you to go in a certain direction, but that area is just inaccessible. The invisible walls are not a big issue most of the time, the only time they have annoyed me so far has been in boss arenas when they trap you in without a visual indicator that you cant leave, and especially in the black loong fight. He does a shockwave like move that I'm sure you can jump/dodge out of the way from, but it seemed like the game wanted you to jump on the rocks around the arena to avoid it. The problem is that sloped areas that look like safe spots were just walled off.The combat is very repetitive. At my current level I seem to be doing the same light attack combo over and over and over again. There are a few spells and transformations that break that up, but the core of the combat for me so far has been light combos and dodging. The skill tree is pretty large and seems like it would take several playthroughs to unlock everything, so maybe the combat opens up later on and I just haven't gotten to it yet.This game is far from a bad game, but it was not the game I was hoping for. In most cases, my complaints are little more than minor gripes, but for me they added up. I would not recommend this game to someone, however, I could see why someone would.This is a little side note, I was hoping for a full exploration of Journey to the West, and I could be wrong, but I feel like the game strays very far from the original story. The opening of the game seems to be the ending of of part 1 of journey to the west, but then it goes in a different direction. Maybe I'm missing something but I was a bit disappointed in that, won't get into too many details here to avoid spoilers.",Not Recommended,1916,25.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9402,"The reason I refunded this game was because of the blurry resolution, poor upscaling implementation, and lackluster performance.The reason I will never buy this game again, is because of the toxicity I have seen in this review section, from the fans of this game. I haven't seen a bigger group of snowflakes anywhere on the internet, in YEARS.From disabled people with epilepsy, basically being told to end themselves, just because the fans of this game lack those certain chromosomes that just so happen to help regulate emotional response. To fans of soulslikes that have issues with performance, or map design, being told they do not have the right to an opinion and should end their lives.This response from the community will do more damage to this game than any negative review ever will. This looks bad on the community. This looks bad on the developers. And this looks bad on Steam, who still at this moment, has taken no steps to moderate this disgusting behavior. I will keep my comment section open to prove this point.Originally I was planning to wait a few months until the product was more stable. Now I can promise that I will never buy this game again, nor recommend it to anybody, unless there are actions taken, and some kind of public apology given, by either Steam, or the Wukong devs, in relation to their toxic fans.",Not Recommended,1107,0.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9429,"This is a good game once you manage to overcome its glaring flaws. It's great to have something based on Journey to the West, but the developers seem to have forgotten the basics of how games are supposed to work.1. We need buttons to move around. No, I do NOT want movement keys buried amongst the letter keys, they are supposed to be mapped to the arrow keys. The developers have not only mapped the movement keys to letters, they have locked out the arrow keys from being mapped to movement like they are supposed to be. I had to install Powertoys and do extensive key remapping to make this game playable at all.2. Games are supposed to have maps. Where is the map here? There doesn't even seem to be a compass. There's a mod to add a map, but we should not need to use mods to add basic game functionality.3. How about some save and load functionality? Believe it or not, sometimes I like to be able to save my game, and load an earlier save. The only way of doing this seems to be to go into the directory with save files and manually make copies of savefiles.4. How about difficulty settings? Doom had 5 difficulty levels in 1993. That is more than 30 years ago now, and the developers here didn't manage to provide any difficulty settings at all. The only way of adjusting difficulty is with mods.",Recommended,1063,110.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9449,"Haven't beat the game yet (stuck on Yellow Loong) but I really like it! It rewards skill, but you can grind as well to improve monkey. Lots of customization for the build of your choice. Gameplay is responsive and I haven't gotten any stutters or crashes. Game is long with plenty of ""side content"" aka optional bosses, areas, gear, and quests. It not really a ""souls like"" game at all, it feels more like God of War or DMC. I like getting frustrated, taking a break, then coming back and defeating the boss first try. The controls and mechanics are very unique, particularly the heavy attack and stance mechanics. The music videos are amazing meta rewards for progressing, I absolutely LOVE their tone/message/quality. No exp boosters, paid DLC, paid early access, microtransactions, season pass, etc. Just a comprehensive gaming experience on the level of first party Sony titles.Some negatives: bad lip sync, lackluster tutorial, slow leveling late game, the ""active"" plot is entertaining but incomprehensible. (It took me over 20 hours to realize I'm NOT Wukong, I'm BECOMING him, maybe??), the first two areas are a bit boring, there are missables you HAVE to Google to get, and UI combat HUD is difficult to read.I'm glad to play this game and I'm excited for the future of the studio and learning more about Chinese mythology. It took me forever to realize Yaoguai just means monster.",Recommended,1157,27.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

The storyline is intriguing and keeps me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game. I love the diverse range of characters and abilities, and the combat system is so smooth and satisfying. I cannot recommend this game enough to all gamers out there - it truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.

9459,"This game is a work of art.It has no difficulty sliders and after spending 4 hours on the final Chapter 1 boss I'm so glad I used a trainer (cheats) for unlimited mana (and sometimes health); for me, the value of this game is in its visual beauty and narrative genius. From the cutscenes to the music I was in awe probably 90%+ of the time.It has one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flaw: you can lock yourself out of quests in really stupid ways. Thankfully, my experience was still extremely fulfilling after missing out on 2 quests tragically at their respective final stages (essentially if you fight an area boss before finishing area quests they are locked forever!).It then has 2 minor flaws: no quest tracking and no map.Between removing the gross difficulty curve, researching and then proving (by finishing with the 'secret ending') the missed quest rewards are no big deal, this game is worth your money and time.The final 5 minutes of the game, during the 'true'/'secret' ending (you'll know because you finish the game ending once then do the 'secret ending' (google it once you've seen the credits roll) and then see a 5 minute animation) is quite possibly some of the most beautiful animation and art I've ever seen.Technologically the game is ""next-gen"". On a 4090, 128GB DDR4, Ryzen 9 I get around 60fps with dips to 40 at times on the preset below ""cinematic"" (which is allegedly meant for screenshot purposes).During chapter 2, the grass was visually glitching a lot and I'm lucky I didn't get a migraine.My final comment is that the last chapter, Chapter 6, is called ""Unfinished"". This is some tragic irony because it feels so unfinished. Honestly: it was terrible (without the secret/true ending) and a real shame and I almost thought the game was in EA because of the ""Unfinished"" part.9.5 out of 10.",Recommended,1489,60.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

This game deserves GOTY; the combat system is fluid and innovative, the level design is awesome, and the story is emotionally resonant.

9476,"Excellent but difficult game. The story focus'es on the resurrection of the monkey king by collecting 6 strands of hair, in 6 realms, the plot is somewhat disconnected and dreamlike, think dark Alice in wonderland. The combat system is weird but addicting. spend some time understanding how to use the skill trees and potions etc. The Graphics imo are the best part of this game, the boss fights are out of this world.

It TONS of boss fights, big and small, secrets galore, cool spells and abilities, many little upgrades and spirits and equipment that provides stat / ability bonuses.The list goes on, but in a nutshell, this game is just FUN. Even when it's frustrating because the boss crushes you like a bug a dozen times, you keep wanting to come back for more. And when you finally kill that boss, oh MAN it feels good. Not just relieving, but GOOD. I think it's because the boss fights, while some are really hard, never feel like 'bullsh*t'.

9489,"A Masterpiece of Myth, Combat, and Philosophy – Black Myth: Wukong Shines!Black Myth: Wukong is a breathtaking blend of action-packed gameplay, stunning visuals, and deep philosophical exploration. As a modern reimagining of the classic Journey to the West, this game does more than just offer thrilling combat and beautiful environments—it invites players into a journey of self-discovery and reflection on existence.At the heart of the game lies the character of Wukong, the Monkey King, who is not just a symbol of power, but also a figure constantly grappling with questions of identity, purpose, and the nature of reality. Each enemy encounter feels like a test of both physical skill and spiritual resolve, with the game's story echoing themes of karma, fate, and the human struggle against inner demons.What makes Black Myth: Wukong so compelling is how it seamlessly weaves philosophy into its narrative. The game invites players to reflect on the idea of transformation—not just Wukong's physical metamorphosis but also the deeper transformation of spirit and will. The challenges Wukong faces are metaphors for overcoming ego, desires, and illusions, mirroring the journey we all take in life to find truth and meaning.The combat system is fluid and dynamic, allowing players to feel both empowered and vulnerable, just like Wukong himself. The boss battles, in particular, are not only intense but symbolic, representing obstacles that test your resolve, patience, and adaptability. Each victory feels hard-earned and imbued with deeper meaning, adding to the sense that you're not just fighting for survival, but for understanding.In essence, Black Myth: Wukong is not just a game; it’s a philosophical journey that challenges players to look beyond the surface and consider the spiritual battles we face in our own lives. For fans of action-adventure games and those who appreciate deeper narratives, this game is an absolute must-play.Bravo to the developers for creating a game that is as thought-provoking as it is thrilling!",Recommended,1725,111.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9525,"An amazing game, but not for everyone.⭐ 8/10I’ve been playing Black Myth: Wukong for a few hours now, and while I’m enjoying it, there are a few things worth mentioning before you dive in.The good:- Visually, it's insane. The landscapes, effects, and character details are breathtaking. I found myself just stopping to admire how great everything looks.- The combat is super smooth and feels epic, but it's also quite hard. If you enjoy dying, respawning, and trying again like in Dark Souls, you're going to love this. Personally, I find it a bit tough, but when you finally beat a boss, the satisfaction is real.- The story is interesting, even if you don't know much about Chinese mythology, it pulls you in just enough. - Plus, Wukong as a character is really cool.The bad:- The difficulty. As a casual gamer, I have to warn you: this game will make you sweat. There are moments when you just don't know what to do, or it feels like enemies crush you with one hit.- Performance issues. My PC is pretty solid, but I was hoping the game would run smoother. There are parts where the FPS drops, and it can be frustrating. (It could be related to my hardware setup rather than the game itself, but it’s still worth mentioning.)- It’s not for everyone. If you enjoy more laid-back games or don't like repeating tough sections, this might not be for you. It feels a lot like a soulslike in some ways.In summary, Black Myth: Wukong is visually stunning and has awesome combat, but if you're like me, a casual gamer, it might get a bit frustrating. If you love challenges and don’t mind dying a lot, I recommend it.",Recommended,1324,35.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

And then I start my 2nd run, all the challenges feeling is gone, my experience grows and gear max making me feel boring. But at least made me enjoyed for 80hrs.

9559,"I do not understand the appeal of this game at all. This combat is incredibly slow and stilted. The heavy attack has a 4 second long animation, despite the fact that every other combat animation in the game takes less than a second, meaning the attack is pointless to time. The game play is pretty standard hack and slash three kingdoms stuff, except there's no hoards of week enemies, only the bosses. This leaves game play designed for frenetic button pressing be repurposed to incredibly slow boss fights with non responsive controls. When I say non responsive, I mean it. I'll hit the Y button to start charging the attack. Hal of the time it will start charge, and half the time, nothing will happen. There is a visual flourish that happens when you start charging, but sometimes that doesn't go off and the charge happens anyway, meaning I can't trust the visual feedback on screen.The game is based entirely around it's dodge mechanic. So if you don't like it in the first hour, refund the game, that part never changes. Every boss battle is just memorizing when you can do the perfect dodges, and the exact moments when it's safe to heal or use a spell. This game also has awful magic. There's no way to restore mana, so I hope you made it to the boss full (actually pretty easy despite the atrocious walk back).Even basic world design is broken. The first area is this giant open jungle area with no signposts. You just wander through, occasionally find an abandoned temple, and that's it. There are signposts that stand out from the environment.i got turned around constantly, because I can't tell the generic temple I'm coming out of, from the generic temple I'm walking to.This game is exploding, and I am honestly baffled. My entire time with the game has felt like a dull exercise in misery. Oh, and for those looking to take in a little culture, it isn't based on Journey to the West, it's a fan sequel.",Not Recommended,1577,6.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9567,"Black Myth: Wukong is a decent game, but it has a number of frustrating flaws that really hampers the experience. In light of this and because it has so many positive reviews, I decided to make this one negative, so that others may find some critique as well.In short the game feels like it has been stretched too thin over too much content. Upgrades feel meaningless, most armor sets are useless and there are very little room for choices when it comes down to it.There are a ton of skill upgrades and a ton spirits and transformations, and nearly almost all of them is pointless. Everything is described in the terms of slightly, moderately, massively and you have to check the stat changes to figure out what actually happens. Most upgrades are neigh meaningless. +1 % crit hit chance, amazing.Armor sets give you special powers, but new ones are almost always better, so you must change. You can upgrade an old set and that would make it stronger, but you only get access to materials after you got a new armor set. Staffs are similar, each increases the damage and crit chance and you just take the bigger one.There are more than 50 spirits, and you won't use 45 of them because they are simply so bad.There are 3 stance trees for fighting with your staff all with their own skills, but none of them matter that much as all three trees are essentially the same. They just have a few moves that look different but give you the same result. Specking into a tree is only necessary so you get a skill you want, not because it would give you any other benefits.The magic system is similarly lackluster. You can't replenish your mana and the skills have limited utility.You can stop some enemies with one for a few seconds to hit them freely. This is by far the most useful one, so some bosses are simply immune to it. There is another one where dash, leaves a deacoy behind so you can have a breather. This is good, but only for healing and pill munching. Pluck of many is the most damaging one, but only if it has been fully upgraded, but it is extremely costly.All other spells are either extremely situational (and will become useful only if you speck into them), or just complete garbage. Ring of Fire for example will buff you, but only if you stay in a small circle. Excellent idea in a game where you have to constantly move around and dodge.On the note of dodging. Either you do it or you are done. Some bosses hit like a truck, easily killing you in 3-4 hits, and the only way to survive is to dodge. Many will have long combos where you just can't get close in fear of getting hit and getting to Death's door.That is it, you have no other options. Bosses usually have a lot of HP too and in general your light attacks are atrociously weak. So with some bosses it's not even worth getting in for a light attack (Scorpion King, Duskveil for example). Thankfully you have heavy attacks, which do work well, but you have to charge focus, by dodging or light attacks. Eventually you fill your focus meter and want to do a heavy attack, aaand you got hit, because your heavy attack for some reason has an animation for consuming the focus points and one for executing it. You may realize that the Thrust stance has the fastest heavy attack and start using that, just so you can more reliably hit.Fodder enemies pose no threat, but since your light attacks are so weak they will hold you up, unless you run past them. Unless you have to fight more than one at the same time. Then you are screwed. Even dodging won't save you, because there is no indicator showing you where a hit might be coming from. You simply have to see it.On top of all of this you have no map! You have absolutely humongous areas, many of which are full of secrets and you won't know where have you been. What did you miss? I don't know. I sorta remember there was a fork somewhere, but where was that? Ahh, who cares. I have read somewhere that the developers wanted to promote exploration. Well, unfortunately almost everything looks the same in a given region. A snowy mountain, a forest, a burnt landscape. There are so few landmarks that could help you orient, that often when a cut-scene would moves me a bit I would get completely disoriented. Horrendous.All in all this is a game that could have been great, but the combat system demands too high of a skill sealing to be fun in most cases. The small damage output makes it so tedious that every build you see online is all about maxing out your damage and crit chance. There is the illusion of option, but in practice there is very little choice. Navigation is very bad and most upgrades are completely meaningless.Finally, as someone who is not familiar with Journey to the West, I have absolutely no clue what is happening. The only thing I could understand there was a big boss monkey, who got smacked down, reincarnated and then that is it. There are a lot of zany characters that just pop in and out of the story, can't tell why.",Not Recommended,4059,45.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

The boss fights feature enemies that can execute 15-hit combos with no openings in between. It feels like a knockoff Souls game. While it oozes intriguing lore and has great art, the controls lag behind the flow of combat, making the boss fights feel unfair. At least Souls games give you a chance to learn enemy moves and establish a rhythm in combat. This game, however, forces you to push a square through a circle in the hope of getting lucky—if you're willing to endure the awful checkpoint system and the overall terrible level design.Edit: This was from the perspective of a rage quit.

9585,"First off, this is easily one of the best games I have played since Elden Ring. Not many games anymore come as a complete package in which you unlock all content by playing rather than purchasing some sort of micro transaction. More publishers and developers need to start going back to basics and make more games like this; making a quality fun game that sells because it is enjoyable rather than gut people for overpriced cosmetics and battlepasses with shallow mediocre games.For Pros:-Combat is extremely rewarding, fluid and extremely fair; there are your typical skill check bosses like any other Souls-Like(Lite) but if you explore everywhere it gives you enough of a level increase to be exactly where you need to be for every boss.-There are an abundance of play styles to mix up the gameplay and try new things.-The game is very polished, runs smooth, looks and sounds great. A lot of care and love has clearly been put into development.-The story is phenomenal, great cut-scenes and a very good adaptation.-All the hardest bosses are optional, so for those stuck on them can still continue on enjoy the story. Can come back later when unlock new equipment, higher level or feel like getting better at the game. Difficulty is very forgiving.As for Cons:-Through my first and second play-through of the game I only came across one glitch/issue. During a boss fight in Ch.5 a boss mechanic kept the boss invisible, allowing you to not target it or do any damage.-For equipment and gear that's randomly dropped isn't a huge issue, except for plants. Having a 30min respawn on all flora makes it frustrating to try and gather remaining missing pieces. Drop chance seems to be better in NG+ rather than first play-through.-Is advertised as a Action RPG, but that will probably make some consumers angry. I wouldn't call it a full Souls-Like, but maybe more of a Souls-Lite.For years I have been waiting to play this since it was first shown off in 2020. It didn't disappoint at all and will be now one of my favourite games ever. Everyone who is on the fence and likes this style of game, just pull the trigger. You will not be disappointed, worth the full price.",Recommended,1794,89.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9598,"Black Myth: Wukong is an epic journey through a mesmerizing world steeped in Chinese mythology. From the very start, you’re immersed in a landscape of breathtaking visuals and an awe-inspiring soundtrack that elevates every moment of gameplay. The graphics are truly stunning, with every detail meticulously crafted, making each environment and character feel alive. Paired with **great music**, the atmosphere of the game feels nothing short of epic.The gameplay is outstanding, delivering a satisfying blend of fast-paced combat and deep mechanics. The combat system feels refined, allowing for intricate combos, parries, and transformations into defeated foes, giving you new abilities to master as you progress. If you're familiar with Souls-style games, you'll feel right at home here. The challenge is steep, especially with the boss encounters, which are some of the best parts of the game. The final boss fight is brutally difficult, but never in a frustrating way. In fact, despite getting my ass handed to me multiple times, I couldn't help but laugh at how well-crafted the enemies and their mechanics were. There's a sense of satisfaction in learning the patterns and improving your skills over time, even as you're beaten down repeatedly.Where the game falters, though, is in the storytelling. While the cutscenes are beautifully animated and the characters are visually striking, the narrative can be difficult to follow if you're not already familiar with *Journey to the West*. I often found myself lost, unsure of what was happening or why, despite the incredible quality of the cinematic sequences. The cutscenes they used to convey the plot left too many gaps, making it hard to fully grasp the stakes or connect with the characters. If the story had been conveyed more clearly, this game would easily be a masterpiece.That said, I definitely recommend this game. The combination of great gameplay, jaw-dropping visuals, epic music, and well-designed bosses makes Black Myth: Wukong a must-play, even if the storytelling falls short. It’s an experience that will challenge and captivate you, and it comes so close to perfection that its narrative shortcomings are easy to forgive. If you're a fan of action RPGs or mythological tales, this is one adventure you don’t want to miss.",Recommended,1935,149.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 22
9599,"absolutely amazing! though I'm a little biased because the 1986 journey to the west show was such a huge part of my childhood, this game managed to take the source material and update it with 21st century sensibilities and technology and present the classic in a new exciting light while paying tribute to the generations of art and literature that came before it that's also based on the classic novel. And that is not even talking about the game play.As a game the combat is front and center, challenging but not unfair. I thought i would not like so many bosses since the stress level of that long health bar is significant for a casual player like me. But once you get the hang of the combat and what the game is trying to get you to do (weave all the tools that you are given at that stage in a fluid and varied way) then the combat becomes more exciting, cinematic and satisfying when you can link all your moves and dodges together.The exploration is just okay tho, the invisible walls are annoying and the lack of a map is very frustrating but hopefully they'll update those issues in the DLC.But the positives of the game way way out weighs the negatives and is truly a classic. Couldn't ask for a better distillation of the stories that defined my childhood.",Recommended,1038,117.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

Invisible walls are definitely an immersion-breaker, but they become much less pronounced after Chapter 1 and do not significantly distract me from enjoying the game.If you like games such as God of War, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice etc, this is a game that you cannot afford to miss!",Recommended,769,129.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 22

9629,"So, I have roughly 45 hours in this game. I'd give it a solid 5/10. The visuals are next level; I mean this game looks absolutely amazing. The game play is just good I'd say. Starts out kind of stale but get better as you gain new abilities. I also like the fact that you can pretty much change your spec whenever you want. Different bosses require different builds sometimes. As far as challenge goes, its OK as well. Some bosses are pretty easy, but then there are a select few that if i never fight them again it will be too soon. Now, with that said, quite a few bosses are just ridiculous. Some of these attacks lake like 15 seconds to build up, then the next 3 attacks happen in like 3 seconds?? OK, I may be exaggerating a bit but still, that mechanic is super annoying hence making the game less fun. Also, why on quite a few bosses do I only hit them half the time?? The hit boxes on some of these bosses are almost non existent. This, to me, makes the game less fun. I cant tell you how many times I've set up a massive hit just for it to but completely scrubbed by some random ass attack. Or when I dodge 3 times too early because the boss has to wind up 10 different times before the attack, i mean wth ??Anyways, in conclusion, it is overall a decent game that some people will enjoy, obviously. But, for the average casual gamer, this may not be a good buy. After I hit that 45 hour mark I began to lose interest fast. So fast, even, I decided to play Cyberpunk from start to finish again. I haven't logged into black myth since.Edit: So, I decided to give this game another chance. I logged back in and well, within 20 minutes I logged right back out. This game is a scam. Do not buy it. You will most likely regret it. I wish I could refund it. Changing my recommendation to do not recommend.",Not Recommended,1458,46.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 22
9630,"Having grown up watching Journey to the West since I was about three years old, it's safe to say that it played a significant role in my childhood. Thanks to Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong captures that magic perfectly. In fact, this game already has my vote for Game of the Year. Everything about it feels exceptional. The lore remains faithful to the original Journey to the West tale, though Baije's character has been slightly altered in a way that adds a fresh and positive twist.The combat is truly among the best I've experienced—precise, well-balanced, and challenging without ever feeling unfair. Visually, the game is stunning, with top-tier graphics and animation made possible by Unreal Engine 5. The soundtrack is both memorable and atmospheric, and the sound design feels incredibly lifelike.However, the game isn't without its shortcomings. Performance can sometimes be inconsistent, even on high-end systems, and invisible walls (which define the game's borders) can detract from immersion, popping up frequently. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself stuck in certain areas. Additionally, the story might be difficult to fully grasp for Western players who are unfamiliar with Chinese culture, Buddhism, or the Journey to the West narrative, requiring some research to fully appreciate the game's depth.Despite these minor flaws, I wholeheartedly recommend Black Myth: Wukong.

9659,"A game I have to thankOut of curiosity, I decided to buy it and try it. I hadn't heard of it until the release date, but that's my fault because I gave up on PC gaming. I was bored.Well, this game brought back that craving that I thought was long-lost.I loved the art direction, the music, the plot, the mechanics and the boss fights. Every. Single. Boss.Fights that I wasn't used to as, it's not my favorite kind of game, yet, there was that constant urge to open it up and admire all it had to offer, once you start you can't stop. It introduced me to a world about Chinese mythology unknown to me, and I enjoyed it.The level of grinding is pretty high, but nothing impossible, and once again I am amazed at how positively I reacted to this, although the boss fights could get to be very frustrating, once defeated they leave you fulfilled and satisfied. In the end, I finished the game much later than I expected, due to the BROKEN AMD drivers (24.8.1) and I didn't want to continue because of the buggy global illumination, but by then I was already in Chapter 6 and the desire to finish it was very high, and so it was, I lowered the graphics settings as a temporary solution and went with the last bosses and the secret ending. I'm on NG+ now and I have 10 achievements left for 100% completion, it's going to be a great new adventure.As far as I'm concerned Wukong is a great game.",Recommended,1128,71.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

9679,"OverviewBlack Myth Wukong is one of the best games I have played in years! I definitely believe it should be in Game of the Year conversations for 2024. I haven’t been as excited for a game or enjoyed one as much as I have in recent memory. The stories of characters and bosses that the game weaves through the Destined One’s journey was done so seamlessly and I found myself wanting more. The game gives you so much lore, with descriptions and backstories for each character, ranging from mobs to Yaoguai chiefs to Yaoguai Kings to characters that aid you on your journey.Perhaps my favorite part of this game were the unique short films at the end of each chapter. At the end of each chapter there was a short cinematic that provided context and a backstory for the main characters of the chapter. Each short film had a unique animation style and I felt the passion, time, and effort the developers put into making each one. This is one of the small things that Black Myth Wukong did to fully immerse you in the story and elevated it as a game to provide an experience I don’t think any other game has ever provided. Truly, a cinematic masterpiece every gamer should experience.GameplayThe gameplay is smooth and fairly consistent. There were a few times in sand and snow biomes where I dropped frames a few times, probably due to the particles, but after changing few settings I never had anymore issues. There are several skill trees which you can spec into but more importantly if you ever want to change you can, at any time! There is no item or system that restricts you from playing the game you want to and I really commend the developers for this. Perhaps my one and only complaint on the gameplay would be that towards the end of the game the difficulty aside from the final three bosses was drastically lowered. The last chapter felt pretty emptyChapter Ratings- Chapter 1 (4/5) Good introduction to game mechanics and bosses. Big baby head was my favorite.- Chapter 2 (4.5/5) Wow this chapter is much bigger than chapter 1. No real hard bosses until the final chapter boss.- Chapter 3 (5/5) Perhaps my favorite chapter. Really enjoyable fights, great story and introduced my favorite side character Bajile.- Chapter 4 (5/5) Long chapter that felt like it was divided into two subparts. Great story and had the best secret area.- Chapter 5 (5/5) Coolest design and environment style but felt short relative to previous chapters. Final boss is cool but I would have like a harder fight- Chapter 6 (10/5) Shortest chapter but has the three final boss fights with amazing cinematics and storytelling.BossesThere are over 100 bosses to encounter in this game. Each one with a unique design, fighting style, and mechanics. I enjoyed each fight. While some were more challenging than others, none of them ever felt impossible. I really enjoyed comparing what bosses I had more difficulty with to my friends. Sometimes I defeated a boss in one or two tries while my friends took over 10 and vice versa. I find this to be a great way the community can come together to talk about what bosses were there favorite and which were hardest for them. Here are my top 5 hardest boss fights (excluding the final ending bosses)1. Yellow Long2. Yin Tiger3. Yellow Wind Sage4. Scorpionlord5. Whiteclad NobleAchievementsThe achievements in this game are not too difficult to get. However, if you want to 100% the game you will be relying on RNG for a chance for an enemy to drop a unique piece of armor that honestly isn’t worth it or for a seed from a plant to drop to deliver to an NPC. Having to farm these RNG drop items can be EXTREMELY frustrating. I have been farming 3 different seeds for one of my last achievements for hours and still no luck. I am currently at 78/81 achievements. I really hope they increase the drop chance for seeds in the future because I would love to 100% this game, it deserves it, but this is a waste of my time. If you are going for 100%, I wish you the best of luck.",Recommended,3283,75.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

I'm in chapter 4 now and the game is a lot of fun. Great level design, many types of cool looking enemies with great fights, cool weapons and armor for crafting and so many secrets to discover. I don't know how they could ♥♥♥♥ up the beginning of the game so much. If you survive the first chapter the game is worth your while!",Recommended,509,42.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 21
9693,"Journey to the West is really my childhood memory. I still remember when I was young, I and my childhood friends played a plot in the original book - the battle between true and false Wukong. Because I have the unique advantage that Sun Wukong and I have the same surname, so every time I played the game, I as the true Wukong knocked down the false Wukong in the end , which also makes my feelings about WuKong very unique. The black myth Wukong activated my childhood memories. In the sixth chapter when Bajie recalled Wukong and imitated the appearance of Wukong at that time, I really cried. Not only for the feelings between Bajie and Wukong, but also for the one who can not go back, carefree, watching Journey to the West and playing Wukong role-playing games of me. I can never go back to that.Of course, despite all this, Black Myth Wukong is also a good game, the fight is smooth, the scenery is beautiful, the characterization is also very careful, although occasionally a little lost, but OK, I still love this game.

9699,"A very mediocre Souls-like game. I don't understand all the positive reviews...Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology. You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.Story & QuestsThe story in Black Myth: Wukong can be confusing and difficult to follow if you are not prepared and know the lore. I did not know much, and felt pretty detached from the story. You need to pay close attention to what every NPC says along the way and exhaust all dialogue. The side quests with various NPCs you meet along the way can be very difficult to figure out what you need to do and when to do it without checking a guide on the internet. Sometimes if you progress the game too far without doing certain steps in a side quest, the quest will be forfeited without warning and you have to try again the next playthrough. You have no journal or similar to keep track of your quests either. This can be very annoying, and is a thing that I ""dislike"" with this game and other souls-games for that matter, even if it's a minor thing.The combat in this game is kinda boring and doesn't get much better the further you go in the game. The game is very bad at informing you about how things work too, for example combos or certain items. The combat is very basic and there are not many combos. The combat is basically spam your light attack, until you build up enough focus points to do a heavy attack and dodge every now and then. Rinse and repeat. Very repetitive. I also don't think dodging works well in this game. I don't know how many times I felt like ""that should have been a dodge or perfect dodge"" but the monkey just didn't do what I wanted. Once you start spamming X for your combo, it's like the monkey is stuck in the combo somehow and you can't dodge. The hitbox in this game is also very bad, especially on some bosses. Imagine spamming your combo on a boss and not a single attack can hit it!You also have some spells at your disposal, which don't always work so well. Let's say a spell takes 2 seconds to channel. If you get hit while channeling the spell, you are interrupted and it goes on full cooldown. It doesn't matter if you did 5% of the channeling or 95%. Full cooldown. Very annoying.Transformation spells transform you temporarily into another creature with different attacks. Dodging in these forms was even worse. Most of the Transformations also have a very awkward attack pattern, so I did not use them much.The Talent Tree is very boring if you ask me. I focused mostly on the Foundation part for more defense, health, stamina, etc. After that I was not tempted by much else in the tree. Many of the spell upgrades, additional attacks and other various upgrades felt quite boring and useless. Why is there, for example, a possibilty to upgrade your usual jump, so it consumes less stamina?A lot of what you find in this game feels like pure garbage. Armor sets and Curios' have no fun effects and many feel terribly unnecessary. There aren't many weapons to choose from either. You can craft new upgrades to your weapons, giving you more Critical Hit Chance and Damage, but with each upgrade the weapon gets a new Effect as well. For example, a certain part of your light attack combo receives shock damage. If you like the effect that the new upgrade has, and then upgrade your weapon again to increase your Crit Chance and Damage, the previous effect will disappear and you will gain a new effect. If you want your previous effect, you have to live with much less damage instead, which is idiotic. Let's say upgrade 5 is max. What if you like the effect on the second upgrade of the weapon and want to play with that, but you can't because you will lose too much damage. Just imagine the difference in damage between upgrade 2 and 5. It's so stupidly designed.The enemies in this game are very boring and feel more like a chore to get through. They are very tedious and are not much of a threat to the dumb monkey you are playing as. Many of them also has a lot of health and maybe even a shield. What usually happens is that you use your spells on them, burning your mana before a boss, because you can't be bothered to kill them slowly. You can pick up materials in the form of flowers, mushrooms, etc. Some of these are hidden enemies in the ground. They jump up and you have to kill them to get the material. They could have skipped this because it was very boring and tedious.This game has 107 bosses. 107! The majority of the bosses are very boring and way too easy. Many bosses are poorly designed as well. That in conjunction with the dodge function and the bad hitbox made me very frustrated many times. Out of all 107 bosses, a maximum of 5 of them were fun. I beat almost all the bosses on the first try, some on the second try, and some on a few more tries. A lot of the bosses are flying around in the air and were impossible to hit and just extremely annoying. How fun is it to fight a boss that just goes up in the air that you can't hit, when you have no ranged attacks? Some bosses also have some extremely annoying and stupid attacks where, for example, they make a lot of whirlwinds that are hard to avoid. If you get hit by them, it triggers a 1 second cutscene of you being flung into the air. Why? Some of these things can be avoided IF you have a special item equipped, that you don't know of, because the game does not tell you. Some bosses also have several automatic cutscenes in the middle of the fight when you manage to remove a certain part of the boss's health. In the cutscene, you get pounded by the boss, which is meant to happen, but when the cutscene is over, you've lost a lot of health. Some bosses are also impossible to hit sometimes even if they are on the ground because the hitbox is so bad. Quality over quantity please.The visuals in this game are very beautiful. The environment is varied through the 6 chapters, BUT. This game has a lot of invisible walls, which was extremely annoying. Many times it looks like you can go to a certain place, or jump up on a certain rock, but you can't. Later you come to a very large area with many paths and space to explore. Suddenly you can go to a lot of places. All this space to explore, for basically nothing. A lot of large, unnecessary areas which only made the game longer and more confusing. Then comes chapter 4, where a large part takes place in a very confusing cave with a vertical layout, with more invisible walls. The stupid thing is that there are times in the game when there are no invisible walls. An enemy will appear and knock you over the edge. What? No invisible walls protecting me now? Chapter 5 is more linear and straight forward and it is much clearer where you can and cannot. Chapter 6 is the shortest chapter but also the most open one. Designing the environment and surroundings this way makes the player very confused and has a hard time knowing where the boundaries of the map are. This created a continuous frustration throughout the game for me.This game also suffers from long loading screens. It also suffers from FPS drops and short freeze lag during some boss fights. Very annoying.Honestly, I don't understand how this game can have overwhelmingly 95% positive reviews. It's a beautiful game with an okay story if you know it, but otherwise, it's very mediocre. I've played a lot of other souls-like games like the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, Elden Ring, and more, and if I compare this game to those, then this game is not very good. There is a lot of room for improvement though if they make a sequel or another game. Too easy with too boring combat for my taste.",Not Recommended,6321,49.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

9702,"So this is kind of my fault, I am playing on an R9 295x2 which is over 10 years old now. This card is a BEAST and still performs this game well but at low render and graphic settings. It did pretty decent except being choppy on cut-scenes here and there but my game completely broke when I got to the end of Chapter 5. I am on the final boss fight for that chapter, have completed it twice now, got the achievement but something with the cut scene makes my drivers crash and it completely corrupted the game files. My fault for playing on an 10+ year old card on a such demanding game but nevertheless, I don't want to bother. For now I am finished with the game and want to review it because I think this game is a game to check out. Graphic wise, it is beautiful. Probably why my GPU struggled so much but you really got to admire what the team at Game Science done with the graphics because it is genuiely stunning. Combat is very addicting. The story to the game holds true to the journey to the west as of so far, so the story alongside the music make the experience so so fun. Only thing I am wishing is that I had a good GPU to fully enjoy this game. I don't want to give a rating just yet because I am not done with the game, I didn't get to complete it but when I do, I will be back to this review.EDIT: I am back to leave my honest review for Black Myth Wukong. This is all around a great and fun game. I mostly enjoyed my experience all the way until chapter 6. I have a few complaints about this chapter but the main thing is it being open world. Don't get me wrong, the concept of the somersault cloud was cool and I did have fun flying around on it but I don't think the open world was executed well...to the point where you might as well not do that and make the chapter like the normal game. For starters, the open area felt so bland with bosses that are more or less re-skins of previous bosses from other chapters. My main issue wasn't that though, there is literally no loot to be found in that chapter. No materials. No chests. Nothing, except one chest crammed all the way in the back of the world with a full set of armor in it. I read online that this armor was supposed to be in the game but was left out so they put it here as some common armor that is barely useful, you can't even upgrade it. This chapter is also really buggy, I had one of the main bosses completely re-spawn because I guess I didn't kill it in the order I was supposed too, which is just a bad game mechanic for an open world area. Chapter 6 just feels rushed to me. With that being said, does all of this make it a bad game? No, it's one singular chapter in a very good game. For some of the good, I think the ending is done really well and I think the first couple chapters are done just as well, especially chapter 1 & 2. These chapters were very enjoyable with all of the early game secrets, and most of the bosses like the Tiger Vangard and Black Bear Guai were extremely fun to fight. I want to give notice to the introduction of the game because it will get you HOOKED and the graphics; the graphics are top of the line and beautiful. 8/10",Recommended,2521,110.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

9706,"Black Myth: Wukong – A Myth Reborn in Spectacular FashionBlack Myth: Wukong is a truly extraordinary action RPG that has taken the gaming world by storm with its captivating visuals, deep narrative, and innovative gameplay mechanics. Developed by Chinese studio Game Science, the game offers a fresh take on the classical Chinese epic, Journey to the West, breathing life into the legendary tale of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, with unmatched precision and artistry.Visual MasteryFrom the moment you step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, the first thing that grabs your attention is the breathtaking graphics. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game achieves a level of visual fidelity that is unparalleled, featuring incredibly detailed character models, fluid animations, and environments that feel alive. The intricate landscapes—ranging from misty bamboo forests to towering mountain peaks—are nothing short of cinematic. The art direction beautifully blends fantastical elements with traditional Chinese aesthetics, offering a fresh visual palette that’s both exotic and immersive.Gameplay and CombatThe combat system is where Black Myth: Wukong truly shines. It’s fluid, dynamic, and filled with complexity. As the protagonist Sun Wukong, players can transform into various creatures and forms, unlocking different abilities that add layers of strategy to each encounter. Whether you’re taking on towering bosses or swift, smaller enemies, combat feels weighty, skill-based, and incredibly satisfying.What makes the gameplay even more engaging is the variety of enemies. Each one poses a unique challenge, with unpredictable attack patterns and environmental interactions that force players to stay alert. The transformations Wukong can perform add another dimension to the gameplay, making it a truly unique experience. Imagine shifting from a swift, agile monkey to a formidable beast mid-battle to outmaneuver and overpower your enemies.Faithful to Its Roots, Yet Boldly NewWhile Black Myth: Wukong takes significant creative liberties with its source material, it retains the essence of Journey to the West. Sun Wukong’s mischievous, rebellious spirit is captured perfectly, but the game adds an emotional depth to the character that makes him more than just a trickster. Players experience Wukong’s journey of self-discovery, marked by introspection and moral dilemmas. This balance between lore and modern storytelling elevates the narrative, drawing players in not just for the action, but for the story as well.Boss Fights – A Spectacle of ScaleOne of the highlights of the game is its grand boss battles. Each encounter feels monumental, combining mechanics of evasion, counter-attacks, and puzzle-solving. The sheer scale of some bosses—like the giant, menacing celestial beings—adds to the epic feel of the game. Every fight is different, forcing players to adapt and switch up strategies, and the reward for victory feels well-earned.Sound and MusicThe audio design is equally remarkable. The game’s soundtrack combines traditional Chinese instruments with epic orchestral compositions, setting the tone for both exploration and intense combat. The atmospheric sound design, from the rustling of trees to the roar of beasts, adds a layer of immersion that enhances the overall experience.Challenges and PotentialAlthough the game sets a high bar in almost every department, some might find its difficulty to be quite punishing. However, for fans of the Souls-like genre, this challenging nature only adds to the game’s appeal. The meticulous attention to detail in boss fights, environmental puzzles, and combat mechanics ensures that players are constantly engaged.Final VerdictBlack Myth: Wukong is a groundbreaking title that redefines the action RPG genre. Its masterful blend of stunning visuals, complex combat, and a rich narrative rooted in Chinese mythology makes it one of the most anticipated games of the decade. Whether you're a fan of Journey to the West or someone looking for an immersive, action-packed adventure, Black Myth: Wukong delivers on every front.With its ambition and innovation, Game Science has crafted a masterpiece that feels like a true myth reborn.",Recommended,3577,15.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

9735,"As someone who watched the Journey to the West cartoon as a kid, it's amazing to see Chinese Mythology get the AAA treatment. The setting is very faithful the source material and the devs have done their homework and have great culutral understanding. The enviroment also have so much detail and is very beautiful.Difficulty is a bit all over with some bosses taking 50+ tries with the most annoying mechanics that you later look up can be negated with a secret item in a secret area that you're not likely to find organically. And some bosses be first or second tried.Combat is fun but feel a bit repetive with just using light attack to build up charge for you heavy attack.Overall, I'm glad that the demo they showcased several years ago wasnt just a tech demo and that it actually released and met expectation and even exceeded it.",Recommended,688,56.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 21
9736,"TLDR; 8.5/10A fantastic semi-linear souls-like experience. The overall feel of the game is that it is an experience of exceptionally high quality, with only a few nits here and there stopping it from hitting 9/10 or similar. If you know what it is like playing Dark Souls games or Elden Ring, then this game is best described by comparing to those games;Where it is Better than Souls Games;Because there is only one weapon type you can use, the player combat animations are much more polished than you would expect from a typical souls like. The bosses combat animations, hitboxes, etc are _nearly_ as good as souls games, but the bosses themselves are much more frequent and varied. Some areas in the game effectively amount to a series of bosses with a few enemies in between. The graphics and environment are much more beautiful than any souls or souls like game I've played.Where it is Worse than Souls Games;The areas and environment, while much more scenic, are much more linear and less interesting from a play-through perspective. This is fine, a trade-off the developers decided to make. However, there are still a few gaps in the environments where (for example) you peer over a waterfall to see what is down there only to find that the developers forgot to add any texture or models down there. There is also the occasional obvious glitch. Hopefully these will get fixed. Additionally the over-reliance on DLSS and similar AI graphics features means that there are occasionally some very weird looking artifacts dancing about. One last gripe: in the last chapter of the game the style of environment changes to a huge open world that you can explore, but this world is almost totally empty. The last chapter of the game is one of the reasons I haven't given this game a 9/10 or higher. The last chapter switched from a good format they had, to one that was less high quality.Summary;The game chooses a more limited experience than the typical souls-like. No character customisation, few weapon types, a linear environment, side-quests only end one way, and only a couple of endings. But because of these restricted design choices the overall quality of the game is very very high.",Recommended,1818,77.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

9748,"I'm really satisfied with the game so far, there's a ton of content, really good presentation and the combat feels really good and fluid.

9749,"TL;DR: Overhyped game.This game is not bad, it's just mediocre.Visual style is great at the beginning and become more and more generic in chapters 2-4.Ordinary enemies don't pose a danger to nameless monkey protagonist. Even bosses are not a challenge most of the time.The only challenge is game length. Distance between checkpoints is ridiculous. Sometime it's too short, sometimes it's laughable long. Checkpoint placement isn't always great. Especially near boss arenas. It's not far away, but almost always you have to run for 30 seconds to arena. And not like in souls games. In soulslike long path to boss is challenge itself. In this game you just run extra 30 seconds to make another attempt.Even though ordinary enemies are no threat they can depleat your MP - it's faster to use ""magic skills"" on some of them then slowly fight them. So the biggest challenge with bosses is reaching them with zero MP.Everythin is odd.Hiden quest lines are almost always odd.Either they are extemly easy - ""extra"" quests in Chapter 1 is activated by ringing 3 bells (yeah not 2 bells from DS1 but 3). And you hardly miss them.Or quests are overcomplecated, e.g. starting Four Loong questline requires you to hit specific wall in Chapter 2. In my opiniopn you have zero clues for that. You only knew that you didn't find important item. Bells from previous example has clear interaction markers and this wall is just ordinarry wall (may be a bit darker than others). And guides I've used tells you that you need to hit this wall in a very specific way.Gear is odd.Skills and abilities are odd. You have very limited pool of magic.And you can switch it only at chekpoints. I've completed whole game with first magic skills obtained. Summon your copies + freeze enemy + smash enemy with spirit + transofrm in other creature + repeat on cooldown = no big challenge with most bosses.Fighting skills are gained with level up. And you can always respec.The game kinda asks you to alter your fighting style with better gear giving bonuses to other attack types. However you are not forced to because of weak enemies.The Plot. As far as everybody knows it's higly influenced and based on Chinese classic novel ""Journey to the West"". I haven't read it. And you will not understand most of the game plot without it or google.Minor spoilers ahead (really minor).To sum up. It's not soulslike. It's ""ok"" as action game with debatable fighing and plot. Give it a try on sales.",Not Recommended,2034,42.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 21
9750,"Pros:-Beautiful backdrops and level designs-Enemies are designed extremey neat looking all the while keeping with the Chinese aesthetic. The final fight in the 5th Chapter was badass.-Fights are pretty simple to understand nothing really to get stuck on except for the Centipede scorpion centaur guy for me-The story was well-paced, knowing the tales of most of the characters here it was a refreshing take on Wukongs story, with a nice and semi-difficult to get twist at the end. I'm really looking forward to the DLC if any ever comes.Cons-Fighting gets realllllllly repetative, it's mash your light to build focus to get in a nice heavy attack, there's no comboing a mix of light and heavy attacks, you just do a heavy slam that if not fully charged you just kinda pause then do the slam attack its kinda weird. There are 3 stances altogether: Smash, Pole and Thrust. Smash does by far the most damage and really easy to pull off that the other 2 stances dont really matter. They help but none of the fights really call for you to get out of reach or being able to cast the thrust heavy attack. They also put in a few weapons that add damage to the other 2 stances but they still dont get up to smash stance. Also with the lack of comboing the others are awkward when you pull them off. Its just boring hitting the same combo over and over when there definitely could been way more put into the fights with the other stances. Wukong has a staff that can grow indefinitely lore-wise idk why it wasn't utilized until the end of the game.-I didn't like how your parry was a cool-down spell. It definitely would have come more in handy as just an actual skill that you could cast freely like your dodge.-I felt as a lot of the main fights you find a cheese way to fight them because you cant really effectively go in staff blazing. I really wanted to go in and just bop some of these guys but man you really got to watch what they do. Don't even get me started on the final fight, I feel no sense of accomplishment on how I fought that last part. Just spent too long diving in headfirst trying to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him just to get forced back because-Your combat at a lot of times really revolved around you casting spells if you had no mana there are some bosses that almost leave no breathing room to counter ans there was no real way of replenishing mana outside of a special gourd that when used also gave back some mana. Not game-breaking but it sucked when I didnt pay attention to my mana usage and stumbling into a boss fight or an annoying enemy to fight.-Stamina also really didn't seem to matter, if your bar was drained you just did less damage and were slightly slower. You could still attack and dodge without really any hindrance.-Keeping with the fighting, the transformation attacks most of them take a year for you to get them off if you're in a major fight you aren't pulling them off unless you use the immobilize spell. Most of them looked cool to use and were difficult to fight considering you had to fight a more difficult version of the enemy to take their soul. All that to try to cast them just to get your ass beat cause the enemy decided to attack you canceling the transformation and you taking damage.-Enemies fighting back. There are only 2 enemies that make an effort to dodge your heavy attacks. I'm not gunna say which 2, but they're easily the 2 hardest bosses in the game, just wish more of the bosses or enemies would have made an effort to dodge prolonging the fight because you can easily cast your boys and help with the whomping and in one instance take half a bar of health from an enemy.-Only a few missables. I missed the headbutt baby wandering vagrant at the start because I fought the ""Secret"" boss in the first area. Idk why that made the vagrant disappear but I was kinda upset I missed him my first playthrough. Also the guy in the bug areas secret area. If you start his quest and kill the main area boss he's just gone afterwards, his quest just asks you to kill the guys around him. He was the entry I missed in my first play in the games lore entries. Just kinda weird how those played out.-Performance, I had to reset the game to my computer's running defaults a few times for whatever reason, I have 3080TI. I would stream to my friends in Discord and the game would lose like 50 frames. I'd stop streaming, the frame drops would continue. Reset defaults to what I had them at and it would go back buttery smooth until something hectic would happen. There were a few fights that went ham with effects and whatnot and that made it pretty hard to fight a boss or enemy to see what was going on.After all this I give it an 8.5/10 it was mostly the fighting with me because this game reminds me a lot of the Modern GoW games as far as combat goes maybe some Sekiro added in too. There's just so much wasted potential when it comes to the fighting in this game. You set the game up with different stances you could have had bosses or enemies that utilize the other stances for attacks maybe gimmick fights that force you to change in between them and each have their own way of fighting rather than a heavy attack that does some little gimmick that does less than the main heavy? I mean GoW Ragnarok has 3 weapons with their own damage element that they utilize in boss fight AND normal mob fights each with their own set of combos so it makes you feel like you have more control of Kratos' actions kinda the same with The Wolf. Instead we get one 5 button combo wait for a charge up and then smack a 5th of a bosses health away rinse and repeat depending on your setup.",Recommended,4575,51.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

GOTY needs Black Myth Wukong to prove its credibility. (Well it's probably not happening for the same reason as why I hate politics)This game is industry-changing. Those amazing landscapes, mythic background musics and depth of stories are blowing my mind. Every cut scene was enjoyable. Without knowing the ""Journey to the West"" book, the experience is still so damn good... But if you dig more into this story, you will find out how deep it goes in terms of humanity and perhaps reflections of class conflict...The only thing I wished it had was a map and made it open world. But it's understandable that Game Science had limited resources and time to bring this game to the market. Well you can patch Map mods though if you really want a map.Now I can't wait for DLC releases, as well as next epic game by Game Science.",Recommended,809,106.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 21
9843,"After beating the game, those 40 hours felt like 80. I mean I can't remember being this immersed into a game in a long time. The level of design and care that went into this is absurd! Every set piece is breathtakingly beautiful, and my god the soundtrack.Many people call this a boss rush, but the fights have a cinematic feel on par with God of War. Most of them are also very difficult. That being said, they are very doable. You know that feeling when you've been stuck on an Elden Ring or Dark Souls boss for ages, only to finally come out victorious? That adrenaline rush? That's pretty much every other boss fight. I don't think I've ever been stuck on a single boss for more than 30 minutes to an hour, but every one of those times I have came out on top with just a sliver of health left.The skill tree is very good and very intuitive. I really wish that I had known when I first started playing though that respeccing your skill points is free and you can do it at any of the shrines. That would have saved me so many headaches.Shout out to Zhu Bajie! Thanks for tanking my hits for me :)",Recommended,888,37.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 21
9844,"Do you like the ability to jump and ALSO love invisible walls!?? Boy do I have a game for you.This is a good game - very souls-like with an emphasis on ""like"". It's an RPG with great combat mechanics and interesting leveling design choices. But let me give the negatives for the die hard RPG and Souls players so they can make an educated decision. This is not Bloodborne or Sekiro combat, and it is definitely not DS. It has a strong bias towards aggression and is predicated on astute dodge timing. But the game is also heavily designed to be an RPG with incremental improvements to stats and checkpoint-gated equipment with the ability to reroll whenever it pleases the player. That can be empowering; it can also make complicated-feeling decisions practically inconsequential.I wouldn't describe the game as hard. Though I've only completed two stages (yes, there are distinct chapters in this game with no congruity), I feel as if I've accomplished far more by this point in a Souls game than the slog I expect for the rest of BMWukong. I would describe the game as tedious, in that each enemy requires the same focus to vanquish as any other, and that makes for a long, consistent experience. But my biggest gripe, and the reason for writing a review without completing the game, is the catastrophic abandonment of world design.I absolutely cannot understand why a developer would allow jumping in this game. If a player just visualized the route of BMWukong the overwhelming majority of this game it would be linear. Yet, in countless areas within just the first 2.1 stages, there are offshoots from that linearity which end in INVISIBLE WALLS. There are cliffs that in any other RPG you could jump off to your death which BMWukong simply won't let you interact with. You could move seamlessly (while unintentionally) through games like WoW and Skyrim by jumping on just the right polygons - this game does not follow that tradition. There are paths which appear to easily be walked across which are simply not a part of the game, despite the graphics showing whatever might lie beyond. I understand wanting to make a graphically stunning game, and this comes somewhat close. I don't get building levels which play entirely different to how they appear.I had found the open world experience of Elden Ring lacking prior to the release of the DLC. BMWukong has inspired me to pick up a controller again. I am hoping to complete this game within the next week so that I can get back to a real Souls game. There are absolutely worse games you could spend $60 USD on, and this is not a bad game by any means. I personally am just triggered by the inability to explore the game how I want. If that means I jump off of 1,000 cliff edges to my death, so be it. But it might also mean that one time I try a tricky parkour move it rewards me with the type of experience that makes RPGs special.100% in 100 hours. Changed recommendation to ""No"". Was dreading playing it further for the last 50 hours. An entire chain of bosses is hidden behind an absurd secret - which also gates about 4 achievements. And then another 2 achievements are gated behind respawns that depend on real time. Same idea as Cookie Clicker, less fun to grind. NG+ adds nothing to the game.The boss rush is possibly a draw for a speed-running community?? The 6th zone/stage/level(?) in this game must be the most frustratingly boring level design I've experienced in a long time. It completely breaks the gameplay loop, which was getting very stale by then, but makes the gameplay even more boring.I could probably map out about 50% of this game from memory and yet I still find myself running down paths that simply don't exist outside of the graphical representation. Invisible walls are still my primary complaint as even the stale combat could be forgiven if the world were actually fun to experience. For comparison sake, I could probably draw a map for DS1 and I haven't played it for years - yet I have no doubt I'd find something exciting and unique if I replayed it today and that will never be true of Wukong. This game is also pretty small compared to its influences, probably no larger than Sekiro.Worth $30 buy it on sale.

I haven't felt that playing a game since God of War or Witcher 3. And not to mention, this is from some random studio that happens to be their FIRST ever game made. Graphics were stellar, combat was next level, and the exploration with secrets and lore to uncover was second to none. All of the cutscenes and cinematics made it feel like you were playing a movie. I have never played a ""souls"" game either and had really no trouble beating every boss this game had to offer. Some were a bit tough but I think the longest I ever spent was maybe 45 minutes on the secret final boss which was the sickest fight I've ever seen in a video game.

9884,"Black Myth:Wukong is this year's Jedi Survivor. It's a souls-lite with stunning graphics and compelling exploration that'll challenge you without making you beat your controller against your desk like a pathetic man-baby (not that I've ever done such a thing). You play as the reincarnation of a monkey deity referred to as Wukong the Destined One, who is set on reclaiming his former powers while taking out his anger on yaoguai with his dexterous staff skills as well as magical powers. Supposedly based on Journey to the West, an epic Chinese novel, the story isn't so much a linear tale as a collection of folk fables. At the end of every chapter, you'll be treated to an artful film sequence that has some relation to the monsters you'll meet. My favorite featured a kitsune (a fox yaoguai) who is rescued by a man from a trap. The man has a dream that the fox turns into a beautiful woman who he then marries. Years later he comes home to her transformed, feasting on their children. When he wakes, the man skins the fox to prevent the dream from becoming reality. You'll later stumble upon her pelt, and you can grant her revenge.Black Myth:Wukong has gameplay that will be familiar to Souls fans. You have a light attack and a heavy attack, and you build up Focus by dodging and hitting enemies. Holding down the heavy attack button charges a heavy attack, which spends Focus points. A heavy attack can stagger enemies, and special moves, triggered by hitting the heavy attack button at the end of a light attack combo, can chew up enemy health. Realizing when to use your Focus points can be the difference in a boss fight, along with your spells. Immobilize is one of the first you get, and it freezes enemies for a few seconds, allowing you to get some damage in or use your healing gourd. Cloud Step makes you invisible while leaving a decoy, so you can sneak behind the enemy and attack. Transformation spells let you transform into certain bosses, complete with a new health bar. Pluck of Many spawns a few copies of yourself to keep foes busy. Potions and various gourds with drinks and soaks allow you to customize your temporary buffs. There is a lot of complexity here, but it's simple enough to be understandable. Also of note are your three staff stances. There's a heavy stance, which launches a typical heavy attack, a pillar stance which lets you sit high above on your staff before swinging it downward, and a thrust stance, which treats your staff like a spear. I prefer the first two, but different play styles will gravitate to different stances.As far as difficulty is concern, Black Myth: Wukong is a hard game, but on the easier side of the Souls-like spectrum. Think Jedi Survivor on the harder difficulty modes rather than say, Lies of P, which I couldn't complete. The spells, potions, and stances give you a lot of options, and you can always grind levels if you want in order to upgrade your gear, although I only had to resort to that method for the Whiteclad Noble, the first true skill test. If you've played Elden Ring and made it most of the way through, you'll not have too much trouble. If you're expecting something like God of War, you might be in for a rude awakening. One notable difference between Wukong and other Souls-likes is that you don't lose experience points (Will) by dying.Graphically, Wukong is one of the best-looking titles of this generation, along with Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5, Wukong features dazzling environments of jungle, snow, and rocky desert. I'm currently making my way through chapter 4 (Wukong has 6 chapters), and the underground spider-filled caverns are startlingly realistic. Only a few low-resolution textures and some overly-shimmering shadows mar the experience. Performance-wise, my Ryzen 7 5800x had no problems, for the game isn't at all CPU-bound like some other more recent titles. My 12 gig RTX 3080 was more than capable of higher settings at 1440p with DLSS Quality upscaling enabled, with frame rates usually in the 60 or 70s, with only a few drops. Unfortunately, there are Unreal Engine transitionary stutters, along with a few shader compilation stutters that the initial compile didn't catch. It's not Jedi Survivor bad, but it's noticeable, especially in Chapter 3. As for ray-tracing, it's only usable on top of the line GPUs and CPUs, so don't bother unless you're rocking a 4090 and a 7800x3d.All in all, Black Myth:Wukong is a thrilling action RPG with great graphics, gameplay, and exploration. Definitely check it out. I've already put more than 30 hours into it, so it's a fairly long game",Recommended,3823,63.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

Then the game properly started and it's all downhill from there.Graphically this game is unmatched, but that came with tons of caveats. The biggest issues stem from its ""Souls"" inspirations, it borrowed all of their quirks without learning their strengths. Exploration is more chores than fun since it's always 50/50 whether a path is actually walkable or just a 60 meters tall invisible wall. The boss fights are visual spectacles but their hitboxes are all out of whack, especially if you prefer the bob and weave fight style. I don't believe these are bugs, but issues in boss design. The game simply only allows defensive play styles.The game is very polished in terms of bugs, but the myriad of design issues, invisible walls, and performance issues made this experience extremely painful at times.

A story with side quests you can actually follow, and it has encouraged me to get into the story of Sun Wukong and Journey to the West and watch lore videos in general to learn more about the characters and events that took place. Complete game right out of the box with practically zero technical issues for me. You can feel the passion put into this game. The cut-scenes, the music, hell there is even a stop motion animation in here. All just so gorgeous and high effort. Massive props to Game Science, I am excited to see more from them in the future!

10009,"The game isn't entirely bad, but it is lacking polish in various ways. At the time of this writing, I am in the middle of chapter 4 of this game.a) Optimization is pretty bad. Game is very hardware demanding for how it looks.b) Unclear progression at times: for one, the pathways aren't really clear sometimes. Feels like running around aimlessly until you get to the right spot, which is boring and not really engaging. The sidequest in the 2nd chapter was really bad as well with not real indication on where I had to go - had to check a guide for that one. Another thing: I fought a boss called Non-White in chapter 3. During the fight around 50%, I happened to fall off the venue to a lower place which somehow halted the boss fight. When I returned, that battle was kinda skipped. I did find him later on and beat him - it just didn't feel as if this was supposed to happen this way...To put it differently: the game sometimes feels a bit loose.c) Gameplay: you do not have much options in how you approach this game. The only defensive mechanic you do have is dodging. There is no blocking, no real parrying. The lack of options feels quite stifling. Especially given this game being on the harder side of games without any possibility to tone it down a little.I find this game to be much more difficult than any of the Souls games. And if purely dodging isn't your usual cup of tea for this type of genre, this game is gonna suck for you. Compared to Souls games or Stellar Blade, where you are able to guard and parry stuff, as well as dodge stuff, Wukong's gameplay doesn't quite hold up to those games imo. Your offense game is very limited as well. You do not have many options in terms of combos or whatever.d) Story: the intro is amazing. The scenes between chapters are awesome. But during the chapters there is a whole lot of nothing story-wise. The side characters in chapter 3 and 4 so far have been great though. There is also a letdown in the main character: during the intro, Wukong is pretty cool in dialogue and demeanor. When the true game starts though in chapter 1 and onwards, your character is mute, lacking any sort of personality. So the character you're playing is pretty much a blank slate - which is a letdown after that intro.Again, the game is not entirely bad. But it is not quite good enough to just enjoy universal praise. It definitely has its flaws and I'm sure with coming games this studio will be able to do better. It's good to have another possible source out there for good games these days.For this one though, do check it out elsewhere before you buy it - the difficulty is relentless and the way you play it is predetermined, lacking any alternative options to get through it. You might not like what you bargained for with this one.",Not Recommended,2270,29.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

10016,"My only background in JTTW is the cartoon I saw once where Sun Wukong challenged Buddha and peed on his finger. Here is my take:1. Overarching story is pretty good albeit straightforward (old monkey says in the opening that you will have to bring back Wukong, Bajie reminds you in chapter 3 in case you forget). Nonetheless, I like the idea of rethreading Sun Wukong's journey to the west as not-Sun Wukong.2. Chapter stories are engaging, lore is fairly deep, well done environmental story telling, overall story telling is unparalleled. I like that I can understand the story/lore on my own (via the journal) without watching 4 hour long videos but still have that option if I really want to dive into it. Overall, if you're big on tragedies, you'll jibe more with the stories being told. Chapter 4 is peak though it could fall flat if you've never had your heart broken.3. Combat has depth though a bit more streamlined compared to Nioh 2. I like that you can dodge/deflect range attacks/parry/counterattack pretty much anything/anytime unlike most modern action rpg games where you are waiting for a boss to finish their attack chain. Landing a counterattack really sets off happy chemicals in my monkey brain. One thing I wish is that light combos per stance different.4. Big bosses are memorable and I like it that they react to something you've done like using a skill or an item on them, makes them feel more ""alive"". Big bosses are well designed and no reskins. There are 4 tiger bosses and 6(?) dragon bosses, all with different move sets! Also, finishing the fight with Erlang and Broken Sage are so good and so cinematic they really made me wish I can fight them again immediately. Now, comparing to say, Elden Ring, I just wanted to finish the Elden Beast/Consort Radhan so I can be done with the game.5. The side/minor bosses, I treat them as ""elite"" type enemies, named since they have ties to JTTW but doesn't really pose much challenge (in ng+0, +1 anyway). I don't think fighting mobs between bosses in any action rpg are engaging so I'm not sure why would I want more of that?6. I like the semi-linearity of the levels, hated the open area in chapter 3, not because of lack of map but because I hate open worlds. I probably wouldn't have finished the game if not for kintoun cloud in chapter 6 (also, did the devs ran out of money at this point? The level is very dead compared to the rest).7. Not bothered with the invisible walls since I know the game is structured linearly like Nioh 2. What I'm bothered with is the inconsistency. I think you can only die from falling in Pagoda in Chapter 3?8.

10079,"The visuals are great and the game play is even better. The bosses are a nice challenge. It reminds me of a souls game. But this feels more like an adventure because it is less forgiving then a souls game. Every creature you KO will give you experience. If you die. You don't lose said experience.Each location has a theme which reflects in its visuals and types of enemies which reside in it. There are the normal enemies which always re-spawn when you visit a shrine (save point). The chiefs which are a bit stronger do not come back once defeated and are a great warm up for the kings. The kings are the bosses of the level and take a bit of strategy. They are the main selling point of the game. Very addicting. Last but not least are the characters. These range from side kicks, to upgrades and even bosses. These bosses are like king fights.Final Verdict. The game feels a bit linear but that's ok. It's great to be able to finally get past the roadblock in your way. The White Snake in the first level (forget his name) is a great battle and sets the tone for the rest of the game. But don't get settled into thinking this game has no surprises. Just when you think you've figured out all it has to offer. It will throw some curve balls. Buy it and enjoy it. See what it has to offer. One thing's for sure though. It's worth it",Recommended,1081,83.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 21

10127,"I should start saying that I have finished Elden Ring and loved it to the bone, though I said myself that I should not buy such games anymore as it is an extreme time consumption if you really want to explore and learn how to play it. I believe I gave ER 200h+ and there were bosses which I had to try 50 times to really achieve a reasonable strategy towards them.That being said, Black Myth is not Elder Ring at all. It is a linear (compared to ER), boss to boss game. I just recently finished the first (standard) ending and going to continue on the the second one.How do I feel about Wukong? Well, there were times when I wanted to destroy my TV - especially with the very last fight with myself and 100eye fella. I didn't have such emotional deprivation with ER somehow. I was thinking - when I perfectly doge 98% of his attacks, kick his a** as hell and yet he still beats me, is this the design I want to play?Then I had a break and think maybe I don't get this game, I must be doing something wrong that after 50 tries (as my limit in ER) I can't beat the last boss..at that time I almost uninstalled the game and wanted to write a letter to the dev team that I am not sure if I am lacking some key skill or they just overkill it being inspired by Malenia**2.So having a few days off and thinking about the game..and somehow, something clicked inside me...I realized that I am repeating same thing as I do in my life - if I can't make it, I just try harder..but throughout my life I have realized that sometimes having step back and do things differently is better than learning hard-core the same thing over and over again.So I started exploring the game again, finished another 2 secret ares which I missed before and after 2 days came back to the final boss and finished him at the first try.My feelings about the game, after accepting the design of the game, are just growing. It meant somehow much more than finishing the game for me. It reminded me my weaknesses in my life, that being persistent and disciplined is not the most beautiful way. It often leads to the result and right end, but not necessarily enjoyable way. Sometimes, just accepting obvious facts, doing things differently and ""go with the flow"" brings much more joy and amazing result..that just happened for me in Wukong and I am grateful to the dev team to providing me almost spiritual journey!Enjoy Your journey and remember, anger, disappointment or frustration can be used in many different ways, sometimes even to find something very beautiful within.. :)",Recommended,2075,76.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10130,"The lore is engaging and graphics are beautiful indeed.But the fighting mechanics is artificially and pointlessly hard, which makes it hard to enjoy the game. You have to get your dodges timed correctly down to the milliseconds to survive and kill some of the bosses. Fighting the boss becomes purely a memory and time counting game with at least 40 attempts. In each attempt you try to memorize each of the boss move and get your timing down. Some of the moves are impossible to react in time to, which is annoying and stupid. Leveling up the skill tree also doesn't gain you much advantage. It still all boils down to your basic attack and dodges, so there is nothing much to look forward to for your grinding. After a while, you ask yourself: Where is the fun? It's probably more fun to play with a stopwatch instead.",Not Recommended,673,89.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10167,"After completing the game, beating NG++ and +100 hours played here are my thoughts of the game:-Gameplay: 9/10, fast-paced action RPG with soulslike elements in the shrines and gourd with charges for healing. The difficulty is challenging but not overwhelmingly difficult, the system is less punishing than dark souls, you almost don't lose progress by dying. The game offers a variety of builds, playstyles and skills to play with, but it suffers from balancing issues as most of the transformations are not worth using imo. Overall the combat is satisfying and fun.-Graphics: 10/10，the game is gorgeous, becoming one of staple showcases of what UE5 can do. Unfortunately in order to max the settings you will need a very beefy gpu like RTX 4080, at least the game offers AI upscaling and framegen to mitigate a bit. Lowering graphic settings and disabling ray-tracing will allow old gpus to run the game smoothly, graphics on medium looks decent. The artstyle is on-point, looks exactly how I always imagine Sun Wukong should look like, looks a lot better than the real life adaptation of Journey to the West.-Story: 10/10, the story is more fleshed out than dark souls but not as prominent as Baldurs Gate 3. It's a continuation of the book Journey to the West, I would highly advise to watch a summary video of Journey to the West with explanations of what the book tries to convey, the story in the book on the surfaces seems to be an adventure of Sun Wukong, but there is always a deeper meaning and a reflection/criticism of society as a whole. The game takes this narrative and criticism to an even darker turn. The most interesting bits are shown in short cinematic pieces of art at the end of each chapter. The line between good and evil is blurry at best and the game showcases how unfair and cruel the world can be.Issues: I have experienced ocasional frame drops and crashes, hopefully they can be patched.Overall rating is 9.5/10, 10/10 if they fix the bugs and performance issues.",Recommended,1652,140.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10210,"A beautiful, unique, and thoughtful game. For those that don't know anything about Journey to the West, it's certainly a bit confusing, but you start to get the sense of things eventually. Still, some research into the story is well worth it for full context. That said, the gameplay is among the best of the year (I'd put it right there with Rise of the Ronin and Shadow of the Erdtree); the atmosphere is among the best I've ever seen; graphics are second to none; music is incredible (especially during boss battles); and the story is great. Voice acting is very solid in English, as well. This is a true 9/10 game.In terms of criticism: some of the chapters are a bit drawn out, and it is nearly impossible to figure out some things (especially access to secret levels) without looking up guides. I'm not a fan of making important content that hard to find, even when I felt I was searching every nook and cranny most of the time. Also (and this isn't necessarily a criticism) don't be fooled by those saying it's not a hard game. Some of the bosses, especially late game, are as difficult as they come. They rival even the toughest in Sekiro, at times. I actually took a bit longer beating some of the final and secret bosses than I did Radahn in Shadow of the Erdtree. Like I said, not a criticism, but be prepared.Overall, a fantastic game and one every fan of the genre should give a try. Well done, Game Science.

I'm on Chapter 1 and have arrived at a boss that i've been fighting for several hours at a time, multiple times per day for 3 full days. I just die die die and get pissed pissed pissed... Now this game is still AMAZING for those who are good at dodging enemies, i for one clearly am not. The game is all about fighting bosses and dodging their attacks, and its EXTREMELY brutal! More so if you arent good at the dodging game, which most casual players (that i know) are not great at.I went through numerous guides, built my character different, played in VERY different ways, and i just cant dodge the attacks without dying. I'm giving this 1 more day of trying and if i cant do it, i'm uninstalling. Its not fun anymore.

10233,"This game is an easy 9/10 for me. If you are a fan of souls-like games then this is a must play, however, this is not a traditional souls-like by any means. It is more of a fast paced fighting game but with some souls-like mechanics. It is not too difficult to turn people away, but it is difficult enough that even a souls-like veteran's skills will be put to the test.It is very demanding, but thanks to upscalers and frame generation even older GPU's should still be able to run it. If you are not using the latest NVIDIA cards and have to choose between FSR and XESS, I recommend XESS as the game doesn't look too great with FSR.Hot tip, if you're running an AMD card, you can use XESS and AMD AFMF together in the driver to essentially use XESS with frame gen. That is how I played most of the game and it ran great.Plenty of content, and plenty of reason to jump back in after beating the game so it is definitely worth the money,",Recommended,757,51.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10282,"Black Myth Wukong is an amazing experience. This game checks all the boxes for me as someone who greatly enjoys action RPG games.CombatThe combat is fantastic, fast paced, strategic, and provides a mix of difficulties. You have some different combos from one of three stances you can use. Each stance provides a different play style or focus from aggressive heavy hits, playing more defensively, and having longer range. You then have different spells, transformations, and a special ability you can use. The spells and transformations are amazing to use, with certain powers working better or worse depending on the enemy. The most interesting combat encounters are the end chapter bosses who have something that can be countered by the use of a special ability, also giving dialogue when you do so. Each boss is interesting and unique, they are rarely repeated. As to not spoil anyone I won't mention specifics but I highly recommend searching for every boss in this game.StoryBlack Myth Wukong's story is great, telling a new journey set after the Journey to the West myth. To keep spoilers to a minimum, the story is simply fantastic, especially if you go for all the secrets and quests. The only negative comment I have with the story, is that each level feels a little disjointed as there is no explanation for why or how you come to the beginning of the next chapter from the ending of the last. Though I believe it is just a different style of storytelling that I am not used to.Final ThoughtsBlack Myth Wukong is a fantastic game that I highly recommend. I did experience a few technical issues such as drops in frame rate during certain boss fights and one game crash. However during my time playing the game these issues were quite rare. I give this game a 9.5/10.",Recommended,1469,74.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

Once I get used to it, I found out it wasn't that difficult but much more enjoyable when dodging,countering enemy's skill.I continue my progress when I'm free and follow the guide on each chapter which is very helpful. Of course I spend hours while fighting the boss and rage out sometimes (especially tiger vanguard). I always take a deep breath and calm myself as I know ""Patience is the key"". if I somehow enjoying the game, I'm willing to complete it no matter how hard it was.The graphics of this game is 10/10 ( If you have a high-end pc) .

10305,"Extremely good game. Not Game Of The Year good, but extremely good. I'll give you one warning and one warning only. This game is hard. When people say Souls like, they mean it's meant to be so difficult you'll want to bash your head against the wall. If you don't like that style of game, then you'll hate this. Please don't buy it and give a bad review because you hate this style of game to begin with. Like playing Baldur's Gate 3 and hating real-time strategy. Not every game is meant for every person.Pros;- Game play is fun and addictive. Leveling is fun, playing with different perk trees and armor is engaging.- Each new Chapter feels like a new world; Forest, Desert, Arctic, Caves (spiders), Lava- Most of the boss battles are unique, meaning the way they move, look, feel to fight in battle are all different. Keeps things fresh until the end.- Story is well written; even journal entries added story I really wanted to know.- This game looks so breathtaking. Many times I had to stop and look around. Brought back a lot of Uncharted 4 feels.- Ran butter smooth on my 3080 and Ryzen 5 5800x.Cons;- 1st real annoyance is the inability to pause cut-scenes. Anyone with wife, kids, or parents knows how important this feature is.- 2nd real annoyance is the devs specifically designed the game so you can easily miss quest lines for good spells/items/gear. Specifically to entice you to play NG+. That is not a challenge, it's an annoyance! And the game is not good in the way that makes NG+ a fun idea. It's a great game, simply not in that way.- Game play is not as fluid as BloodBorne. The un-interruptible chain attacks like in God Of War (4th) was annoying.- Bugs; Message stating ""Save failed..."", but it saves just fine. Message stating ""Partial controller support"" on steam, but controller is full functional.- Finally, that ending is trash. The idea that you must beat the game a second time to get the good ending and only by beating the game twice is a pure trash move. Though I did enjoy the final boss fight, simply didn't want it to be the last one.Well worth full price!!!",Recommended,1720,163.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10319,"Solid game if you enjoy the Souls games, but aren't exactly the best at them like myself. I found Wukong easy to pick up and hard to put down with how invested I became in the story and how stunning the scenery of the game is. The enemies are variable and numerous with exciting challenges in every chapter. The bosses offer challenges that test your knowledge of your abilities, your reflexes, and sometimes push the idea you need to change up your play style ever so slightly to counter abilities of theirs.I will say that if you enjoy finding secrets on your own without online guides, then Wukong is perfect as the secrets in this game aren't hard to figure out if you spend a little time investigating or learning how the game designs the world. It's nothing that's incredibly complex, but sometimes more a game of patience and returning to previous areas at a later point. I love the feeling of returning to a place I couldn't access on my initial visit only to find an item later that hints at being the solution. The in-game journal has tons of in-depth lore that you can also use to figure out how to find more secrets. Additionally, it all builds on itself and references other entries that help build smaller stories within the story.Overall, pretty solid game that's worth investing some time into for a 100% completion or simply for the experience of the game.

10330,"As someone who knew of Sun Wukong but having never read Journey to the West I picked this game up on a whim. I had seen trailers as early as a few years ago from The Game Awards to the devs posting an update they were switching to Unreal Engine 5. I'm only just at the beginning of Chapter 3 but I have loved every minute I've played so far. The game alone has made me want to start reading Journey to the West.The combat in this game is so fluid and feels nice pulling of combos, the music is very well done, and the story with Wukong and other characters is really nice, but sometimes I feel you nee to really understand to Journey to the West to appreciate all the characters more because the game gives no explanation or exposition on who or what anything is.I will say my two main complaints about the game is there's no area map. I'm not expecting a very detailed map but something for the chapter area would be nice as chapter 2 is a lot bigger then 1 and I was having to remember where I had been to where I was going a lot that sometimes it felt I couldn't remember where I as heading.The other complaint I have which isn't a huge deal breaker for me is the invisible walls in game. There's been plenty of times I want to go explore an area to immediately get hit with a wall. I understand this is Game Science's first 3D game so I can cut them slack but sometimes it is jarring to be exploring and then immediately have to turn around because the way I thought I could go I cannot.If you are one to like the action combat of the Devil May Cry series or the Bayonetta series I have a feeling you will love this game.",Recommended,1307,133.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

The first 2 chapters are a masterpiece, good exploration and fights, some challenge but doesn't feel outright cheap.Chapter 3 is probably one of the worst pieces of gaming I've played in a long while, lots of annoying mechanics and deviations, that while individually would probably be alright, when all combined just feel terrible.Chapter 4 is a bit better, but from this point out boss fights start to swing all over the place from ok, to challenging but fun, or just outright cancer, theres no consistency and it starts to feel like the devs just went for the hard for the sake of being hard design vs challenging but engaging.I'm on chapter 6 at the time of writing this and am half leaning towards dropping it, the fun parts are feeling less rewarding compared to the not fun parts.",Not Recommended,731,54.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10385,"9.5/10I very rarely feel compelled to write a review but this game blew me away. My completionist, true ending playthrough took me 50 hours and I am going to 100% this game and play through it again at least once, maybe multiple times, which is also very rare for me.This game succeeds exceedingly well at what it wants to be, which is a semi-linear game with satisfying, fast-paced combat, a ton of fun & unique bosses, and some big story beats. On top of that, it smashes secondary things out of the park. The graphics, the setpieces, voice acting and dialogue, music and sound design, lore, chapter-end animations, etc - the quality and sheer attention to detail in every aspect of the game truly make it an immersive experience. It's very clear that the devs have a ton of love and passion for this game.The highs of this game are so frequent and often so insanely high that I forget all about the infrequent lows.+ Stunning, immersive visuals. Everything looks amazing, including the environments, the enemies, the lighting, and the visual effects. Even the physics for the cloth, hair, and environmental sand/snow. There are a ton of beautiful setpieces, many scanned from real life locations by the devs.+ Bosses are epic. Almost all of the designs are a hit, although a few were really frustrating. Many are absolute cinema. The highs far outweigh the lows.+ Combat is great. I often see people online complain that it's shallow, but it's only shallow if you make it that way. If you want to stick with a simple, repetitive approach you can do that. If you want to use more complex combos that are higher risk and higher reward, you can do that as well. I go for the latter, and pulling off certain moves is immensely satisfying. Some people will dog on the combat without even exploring what you can do. It's as if they didn't even read any of the skill tree descriptions. They will straight up lie about the amount of stuff you can do. It pisses me off.+ Music and sound design is insanely good. There's a ton of music variety and it never felt repetitive. The sounds are crisp and there's so many little sounds that tie everything together, like the rustling of plants and sounds of insects and birds. The music varies between being super hype, giving me goosebumps, or bringing me to tears.+ Exploration is rewarded well. There's a lot of missable content and each chapter has a secret area. The game being (semi-)linear does not feel like a limitation. For me it strikes a great balance between being too linear and being open-world, i.e. too little or too much to explore. Chapter 1 is more linear than the rest of the game.+ English voice acting and translations are great. It's clear that a lot of effort went into making the translations rhyme properly when needed.+ Story and lore is great, although often esoteric. It isn't shoved in your face but it's there for those who want it. You can figure out most things just from paying attention to the dialogue and cutscenes. Also, each unique enemy has a corresponding journal entry that has a stylistic illustration, a short poem (that always rhymes even in English), and a story. Some key characters' journal entries can reveal a lot.+ The chapter-end animations really stood out. They go insanely hard, especially from chapter 3 onward. One of them brought tears to my eyes, which is especially hard for games to do to me.+ Overall attention to detail is incredible. The game feels very polished and immersive and it's obvious that the devs cared a lot about making a great game. There's so many things that made me go ""wow, the devs went above and beyond"", such as (but not limited to) the reactive environments and some characters having reactive dialogue depending on certain spells you use.- Story-wise, the first 2 chapters generally lack story beats that apply to the player in the present, they're more about discovering things that happened in the past. I think this is a big reason why this game has a lot of ~8/10 reviews from journalists. It was absolutely worth playing through the whole game though, as the rest of the chapters pick up the slack in that regard.- Performance chugs sometimes. This game is fairly difficult to run. There are occasional stutters and crashes. I also saw some occasional graphical bugs. However, turning the settings alleviated these problems and the visual difference wasn't that noticeable. This game also has a free benchmark tool on Steam which is great.- There are a lot of invisible walls that feel out of place (don't align with what the environment shows) and are a bit immersion-breaking.- One specific section of Chapter 3 had really annoying level design. That was the only time I got legitimately upset with the game. The rest of the game more than made up for it.- A few bosses have wonky targeting. Like, a giant 2 or 4-legged boss will only auto-target one leg. A big boss will only have one specific spot auto-targeted and I'll move in weird directions when I'm trying to hit it.- Some bosses need closer checkpoints, it's annoying to spend 20 seconds walking back after dying.- The staff stances are great overall but pillar stance could use some more moves and is a little underwhelming compared to the other two stances.- Character lip movements only work for Chinese voice acting. When playing with English voice acting, the lip movements don't line up. I stopped noticing it over time.- No difficulty options. This wasn't a problem for me but I just wish this game could be enjoyed by players of any skill level or people who just want to chill and play for the story.",Recommended,4623,67.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10398,"It's fun to get a game that explores a different mythology setting than what you're used to. I highly recommend reading the Journey to the west books before playing this to understand the story a bit more, but if you have a hard time reading then there is a series on youtube that covers the story there.So heres my review:In a soulslike fashion it is a great experience though but long overdrawn segments of the later chapters can be boring, but exploration is a factor which balances that out since you can find so much. I really do love that exploration doesn't lack content. In the form of mini bosses, secrets, developing your character through pills you can find, meditation spots with beautiful visuals of the soroundings and filling up your journal with info about this worlds creatures you find on the journey. The game just fills most of the empty space in a big world. This makes me want more.I would give this game a 9/10 for the aesthetic. The visuals are just stunning.A 8/10 for the combat, you can seriously only do so much with what you get but still combine stances and do combos to a certain degree.A 10/10 for the progression system where you can literally respec if you want to try another build with so many abilities to choose from.And last but not lease i will give the overall story a 8.5/10. Keeping this spoiler free I will just say that I just like the characters and what they bring into the destined ones Journey throughout the game.",Recommended,1201,60.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10429,"Probably the best single player game I've ever played, the responsiveness and fluidity of the movements are insane, as in you feel one with the monkey haha (especially as he literally doesn't speak a single word lol), the graphics look amazing and the story is intriguing at least (even the myths and legends you can read in the journal are captivating).Also, the fact that you don't have a minimap and you must explore yourself felt a bit odd at the beginning but I embraced it and now I like it a lot. The gameplay experience became way more immersive this way.This is a work of art, you must try it yourself and you'll certainly reach the same conclusion. I've almost finished the game, I'm sad it will be over but glad it happened...The company is called ""Game Science"". Well, this is how a Game of the Year it's done. They stayed true to their name.

Every location feels alive, and I loved exploring the lush landscapes,The combat mechanics are where the game really shines.Transforming into different forms added an exciting layer of strategy.The storyline also kept me engaged.

Level design and combat options are very sparse. Technical issues galore. Lighting is very bad, leaving a lot of areas too dark and hard too see. Hit boxes are very erratic. Hard to cancel out of animations and button inputs get missed constantly. I did enjoy what little I experienced of the story and characters. When not screen tearing or having weird hiccups, the game looks beautiful. Wanted to love this game, but I had so many issues with it from both a tech and combat perspective. I understand that many people enjoyed this games difficulty, but it started to feel like a slog around the middle part of chapter two.

10529,"“I’m now at Peace. Your Journey, Though, Has Just Begun”Black Myth: Wukong is THE BEST game i have ever played till now. The narrative, the characters, the gameplay, the world design, everything is a deep appreciation to the epic tales of The Journey to the West, and the developer Game Science's take on the story of Sun Wukong and to become the Victorious Fighting Buddha, aka the Monkey King.This game was an adventure to say the least, to be in the hide of the Destined one, and to experience the tales that the Great Sage has lived through, following his footsteps.The story is placed after the events of the Journey to the West, with the stories divided into six chapters, and each teaching us essential life lessons. We witness how many of the characters for the book are facing with emotional constraints: like greed, pride, lust, sorrow, loss, and many more; and how each chapter concludes with a very sweet and emotional music video made with different animation mediums to explore these emotional but moral teachings.Every moment I spent in this game has made me a witness of how rich and beautifully designed a game could ever be. Every details, designs, art direction are at their finest; and the higher form of narrative that the game revolves around makes me appreciate it even more. It's really hard to believe this was actually one of the first AAA games from China.Long story short, this game has become a very influential part of my life and have given me deep appreciation to the rich narrative stories and life lessons the tales from Journey to the West imparts on us.There had been rumours of this being a part of the Black Myth trilogy; with one rumoured to be Black Myth: Jiang Ziya. So if the other one turns out to be Black Myth: Nezha, you can count me to be in the front of the line and my sincere support to the Game Science team.",Recommended,1528,77.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

Stunning visuals, an incredibly large variety of enemies, and a surprisingly deep combat system that becomes important to fully explore as the challenge ramps up.It's tough at times, and with SO many bosses it's not surprising that there's a couple of swing-and-misses. However, when the boss fights are good they are as thrilling as anything you could find in the Soulsbourne games.The invisible walls are an unfortunate choice, and there is definitely a level of jank in the game. If you want to understand the story you should probably brush up on your Chinese lit. However, it is charming throughout and, evidently, a labour of love from the devs.I put in 100 hours in order to get both endings.

This game shows what should be the standard in the Industry for a 50+ Euro game.Also, the possibility of exploring the more linear world and meeting interesting characters and their side quests adds more depth to the game.Even though it's not an open-world game by definition, there are still a lot of places you need to discover actively, and if you follow the ""main"" path, you will simply miss a considerable chunk of the story.No microtransactions or any other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, just a complete game that gets more and more interesting and does not feel repetitive at all.Everybody who likes smooth action RPGs with beautiful scenery and a smooth combat system won't be disappointed.You can easily invest 100+ Hours into this game without getting bored so that you will get your money's worth.All Black Myth Wukong is one of the best games I have ever played, and I absolutely recommend it.",Recommended,1460,39.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

I've collected all 81 achievements, and I feel qualified to share my thoughts:A. Graphics: The visuals are truly a game-changer.B. Smoothness: The game features virtually no loading times, resulting in an incredibly smooth experience. (After defeating Erlang Shen, there was a brief lag of about 1-2 seconds. I suspect this was to prepare for the next epic battle, but overall, it's a clever design. The seamless experience is genuinely impressive.)C. Gameplay: Each player can develop their own unique fighting style. This action game emphasizes battling yaoguais and bosses, beautifully incorporating the essence of three stick stances from Chinese martial arts. Players who master these techniques can create combat scenes akin to those in martial arts films during boss fights, making them highly entertaining. Plus, you can transform into previously defeated bosses, further enriching the combat experience.D. Story: I recommend diving into the original Journey to the West, particularly Chapter 16 (The Guanyin Temple), Chapter 21 (The Yellow Wind Sage), Chapter 59 (Flaming Mountain), Chapter 65 (The Yellow Brow), and Chapter 72 (The Spider Cave). These chapters contain stories featured in the game, and knowing the source material can be beneficial when facing the final bosses.E. Creativity: One chapter places you in a miniature landscape that is, in reality, a tourist attraction. Trust me, even if you visit this tourist spot in Shanxi, China, you won't be able to appreciate the sculptural art up close as the game allows.F. Respected Boss: The boss designs are incredible. Many encounters won't feel tedious or grinding; instead, you'll find yourself eager to challenge them again after each defeat. My number one hardest boss is the Yellow Loong.",Recommended,2841,177.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 20

10562,"-Graphics: They are so good it's bad for the game. It makes no sence that a game so visually realistic limits the space the player can go with invisible walls, it get's you out of the inmersion to try to reach a tree and not being able to get to it. I don't have a problem with the game limiting the space of the player and not being an open world but there are better ways to do it.-Gameplay: The first 20 hours is so enjoyable but 2 out of the 3 stances feel so bad I just stopped using them and sticked to the first one.·The pole stance's heavy barelly has any use cause it takes so long to charge it and you cannot move nor dodge while you are doing it so majority of times enemies are just going to take you down (and there is no timing for using it cause bosses' attack windows are so short for it to be charged to the maximum damage and all of it for doing less damage than the basic stance) not to talk about the variety combo it brings which is just useless.·The thrust stance feel so good and fun to use but it consumes so much stamina for ending up doing less damage than the basic stance (and with worse variety combos as well) that it's just not worth using.-The bosses: Only half of them are fun. The other half have straight up bad hitboxes which makes that sometimes hits you see connecting do not, making you waste the focus you've stored up (and the mana if you used the invis) with no reward and not because you missed but because the game decided that you did. There are also some bosses' mechanics that feel unfair such as some of them doing an undogeable grab that takes half your HP away for changing fases (some bosses do this twice) or spending half the fight flying while attacking. These kind of things majority of bosses have makes the game stop feeling challenging and fun and start feeling annoying, stressful and unfair as majority of bosses are only hard cause of these things and not because the bosses' attacks are hard to time or predict.Overall a dissapointment. First half of the game was really fun and felt like a GOTY but as the game progresses it gets artificially hard by pumping up bosses' damage, annoying hitboxes and unfair mechanics. It's a RPG that tries too hard to be soulslike that ends up being a pain in the ass.",Not Recommended,1838,48.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10582,"I have to admit, I was initially both skeptical and very intrigued by Black Myth: Wukong. The trailers, especially the stunning 2021 showcase for the Chinese New Year, certainly grabbed my attention. Now that it’s finally here—what a ride!The combat system in Black Myth: Wukong is one of its standout features. It’s fluid, lightning-fast, incredibly responsive, and offers an impressive range of options. Whether you prefer quick dodges, precise parries, or unleashing a flurry of attacks, the system keeps you on your toes, and mastering it is highly rewarding. Progressing through the skill tree feels empowering, as each new ability unlocks more depth and variety in how you can approach battles. There's a real sense of growth as you master the mechanics and refine your playstyle.Though it’s not an open-world game, Black Myth: Wukong more than makes up for that with its gorgeously crafted universe. Every environment is steeped in rich detail, drawing from Chinese folklore with an incredible level of care and precision. The world feels alive—thanks to stellar modeling and animation. The sheer visual spectacle is something to behold; you might even find yourself pausing mid-battle just to admire the scenery (before promptly getting smacked by an enemy, of course).Now, onto the minor downsides: I was hoping for more exploration. The game feels a bit more linear than I anticipated, and I found myself wishing for more opportunities to venture off the beaten path. Additionally, the combat—while exhilarating—sometimes suffers from visual overload. Effects are so abundant that they can make battles a bit disorienting.Despite these small criticisms, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredible triumph. The combat system is a joy to engage with, and the imaginative, vibrant world is captivating. Game Science has done a phenomenal job, and I can’t wait to see what comes next from this team!/!\ ""GOLD"" on ProtonDB, playable, but quite heavy on Steam Deck.

10589,"Overall: 9.5/10The legend of the monkey Wukong... I was not expecting this amazing game for sure. I came with a view of a souls like gamer, however it is not like that, you can't judge this game by the lenses of other game, you need to see it as a game of its own and that is what this game is! This is a complete game and without that petty little things companies try to put into the games to passe a ""message"" or some greedy monetization.Positives:-You can respect your whole skill tree for free and super easily that is amazing for different builds or to find a different path to defeat specific bosses.-Cloud part is so smooth, travelling in the cloud is very refreshing and well done.-NO PAID PASSES !!-Secret final super cool!-Story in a whole it is pretty interesting to me since I never saw the tales of this region, didn't know the fox tale or the Wukong story, it was a good experience and well told!-Gameplay wise it is very good, very responsive, only one or another boss attack I would say it is not so polished but for the most part the fights are truly skill based git gud kind of stuff.-Diversity of builds, you have tons of different builds to explore!Negatives-Bugged while dashing near a fall and bugged out, needed to reload the game.-Since you don't have AOE it becomes annoying to deal when there is a great number of enemies, even harder then a boss sometimes.-There are some dead zones where you will find no enemy, no material, almost nothing just an item at the end of the ""road"", it feels blend in those areas.-Achievements basically 40% you need guides, and that for me takes me out of the game... and missable items are just annoying as hell.-One or two bosses have a specific attack that it is not telegraphic and you need to do the dodge before the visual cue which was frustrating.-If you don't do the final secret boss the story ends in a blank state, however if you do the secret boss you get to see the continuation of the story for a bit until you defeat the boss and then... boom cliffhanger, but I know it will come a DLC to continue the story so that is not that bad. But being the true ending behind secret stuff and needing a guide for it, it is annoying.-Doing the 100% was boring in the last part because of the missable and the farm that you need to do for some items...Monke!",Recommended,1892,55.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 19
10590,"First of all, I meet the required stats for this game, but it silll has some serious lag issues especially in the cutscenes.The start of the game and the first couple of bosses are quite easy and the game is kinda boring, then it gets better with challenging bosses, and then they remove all the fun by having easy bosses with cheap tricks like unavoidable damage or restricting your movements to make it harder just for the sake of it. Some bosses even hide behind invisible walls, you cant attack them while they are attacking you, its ridicolous. The hitboxes also are far from perfect with some bosses, sometimes you are right in front of them but you are hitting air with 90percent of attacks, like wtf..The leveldesign is just awful in most cases because of the invisible walls everywhere, its basically a corridor to the next boss. I thought I am a monkey, why can I not climb? But seriously, I get that they wanted to make the game more linear, so exploration is not the biggest part of this game, but besides the mainpath there are no indications on where you can and cannot go. You have to manually walk up to areas that look like you can go there only to find an invisible wall, and if your movements are haevily restricted like that it just discourages you from even trying to explore. I found some hidden areas only by accident.Another thing that I didnt understand is why they included the jump button when Wukong also jumps just by walking at a jumpable object, and then the jump is not really usable in combat, you can dodge like 3 attacks in the whole game by jumping as far as I know, I got tired trying to use jump because its just not really a tool to dodge I guess.The combat is fun for an hour at a time, but since the levels are so uninteresting and repetitive with all the temples and buddha statues and the game also has some serious lag issues during the cutscenes so you are better off skipping them all, its just not a game I would recommend to anyone for that price tag.",Not Recommended,1629,43.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10602,"Imagine, if you will, that you’ve had a long day. You’ve slogged through meetings, emails, and the general bore that is adulthood. So you get home, crack open a cold one, sit yourself down in front of what should be a beautiful escape—this game—only to find it’s about as relaxing as being slapped in the face with a wet fish while someone screams at you to “git gud.”Now don’t get me wrong, it looks fantastic. Gorgeous, even. And there’s a story here somewhere—probably. But here’s the rub: it’s so f*cking difficult that any chance of actually enjoying it vanishes quicker than a wet fart on a long car ride. There is no option to adjust the difficulty. None. What kind of sadist thought that was a good idea?Now, before you accuse me of being some sort of gaming amateur, let me clarify. I’m not half bad. I can hold my own, I don’t panic-mash buttons like a toddler on Red Bull. I know my way around a Souls-like game. I’ve tangoed with Elden Ring, and yes, I came out the other side—bruised but alive. But this… this is like being dropped into a washing machine set to “violent spin cycle”.Five hours in and I’m stuck at some man-lizard. Yes, you heard that right—a lizard. Some soggy reptilian monstrosity that I’ve been pounding my head against for what feels like days. And when I finally do defeat this oversized garden pest, there’s no rush of victory. No, no. It’s more akin to the feeling of squeezing out a particularly stubborn constipated turd that's been brewing for days after a dodgy curry. You don’t feel triumphant. You just feel relieved that the misery has ended.And then—then—you begin to dread what’s next. What fresh torment awaits just around the corner, ready to batter you senseless while you sit there wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea in the first place. I’m bored, I’m frustrated, and above all, I’m angry. Angry at the developers for not giving us a difficulty slider, and angry at myself for stubbornly sticking with it, thinking “surely, surely the next boss won’t be as bad.”But of course, it is. Of course, it bloody is.This game could’ve been a masterpiece. It could’ve been the perfect hybrid of Elden Ring and God of War—a balance of challenge and enjoyment. Instead, it’s like being repeatedly punched in the face by someone who insists it’s “for your own good.”So here’s my advice: if you, like me, want to unwind with a game that has a bit of challenge but still allows you to sleep soundly at night, don’t touch this. Save yourself, your sanity, and your poor wife’s eardrums. Play something else.EDIT: I beat the stupid lizard. I played for another excruciating three hours, pummelled a few more bosses, and guess what? The experience was as enjoyable as licking a car battery. Eight hours in, and I’ve uninstalled the game.

10629,"GamePlay:10/10Definitely an amazing game, it is not as hard as a souls-like game but also not easy, you can have good times challenging the bosses without frustrations, also the progression is quite good, I feel I an really enjoy levelling my character and also experimenting different build variations without getting concerned to commit mistakes once I can anytime reset them.Story-wise:10/10The game is also amazing and bring to us a slice of this beautiful chines myth. There's not much I can tell in this regards it is simply amazing, and the way to tell the story makes everything even more poetic.8/10IMO, the vegetation makes everything beautiful, nevertheless is it not something from another world.5/10Well,I can play everything on ULTRA with RTX on (low). However that's a generation problem and I really believe this could be by far better, as we are already used to see on such games made on top of UE5, they look beautiful but also lack of performance.

It’s like enjoying Italy for the first time in Assassin’s Creed 2, with no political nonsense in between.I like this game; however, after you get the true ending, there’s not much else to offer. The end game feels very tedious as you do everything all over again with your ultimate abilities unlocked, while the enemies remain the same except for a slight damage and HP buff.Combat is just okay. Most bosses are sponges, with only a few of them actually being fun to fight. It’s mostly just dodging attacks and using magic in between.This game is a 9/10 compared to most other games, but when compared to other souls-like games, especially those by FromSoftware, it’s only a 7/10.",Recommended,1077,92.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10636,"The gameplay of Black Myth Wukong is great, but it has its flaws. However, these flaws do not affect the gaming experience, as there may be situations where players cannot hit large bosses. From a map perspective, sometimes the guidance on the map is not clear, causing players to get lost. Some people say that air walls greatly affect the game experience, but here I want to say that the map of this game belongs to linear maps. The official plan is to deliberately guide players and make this game like a movie, giving players a good performance. In terms of story evaluation, this game has several factions, each guiding the protagonist to kill the boss for profit. Some stories require players to explore and collect various props to see, including Maitreya Buddha and Erlang God, Lingshan and Tianting. Many people only hinted without explicitly stating it. Overall, Sun Wukong rebelled against the gods and against injustice in the world. Everyone was a pawn, and Erlang Shen was also a pawn.",Recommended,829,82.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 19
10637,"Overall a great game.It's visually stunning, at least on my PC I didn't have any performance issues (while playing on very high settings) - I think the game went below 40 FPS only during one or two fights, which for the amount of bosses in the game isn't bad.The developers really made a great usage of Unreal Engine capabilities and had some really awesome executions. I think I was most impressed (visually) by one of the scenes from chapter 4 - those who played will probably know which one and the fact that modern PCs are powerful enough to handle that sort of things in real time.It's not a game without flaws, certainly, a lot of the bosses are too easy, while others are just made artificially hard, such as you needing to punch them for 500 years to deal any damage, or bosses so aggressive that a single fail during few minute fight often times resulted in death during. The designs where bosses go out of reachable to the player location and start spamming you with attacks, while you're just sitting there waiting like a dummy also weren't that fun.(SPOILER, but not really) Tip here: often times, if a boss seems too hard, it's likely because you've missed (or are not using) some item that was designed to make the boss SIGNIFICANTLY easier (gosh, I wasted few hours at one or two bosses only to then find out, that I also missed some item and after getting it all of the sudden I beat the bosses on ""first"" try).The combat overall is also quite stunning, although responsiveness of certain interactions feels extremely limited at times (there were so many instances of me dying, because I was pressing a heal button like crazy and the character would just ignore it, even though he wasn't recovering from roll or anything like that), but you can compensate for a lot of it with the skill trees (for example, there's a skill that allows you to get more invincibility frames during dodge, which made the game 100x easier :P).Not sure about the replayability factor of it however, there's a new game+ and I've went for it, but on the second go I kinda got bored - the bosses posed no challenge whatsoever and in the middle of chapter 3 I kinda got bored of it (maybe it scales better with further new game+'s, not sure about that one).There are also certain chapters with some super annoying level designs and gameplay mechanics, but frankly, the game was so fun, that after two or three weeks after finishing the game I almost completely forgot about those parts and just remember how cool, fun, visually stunning and fairly unique, especially in terms of modern games, the experience was.I'd rate it 9/10, since perfection doesn't exist and there were some design elements that were a bit annoying, but a really great game overall and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Even more so, given that we didn't really get many games with Chinese mythology.",Recommended,2358,37.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10690,"Black Myth Wukong return to monkey is an action pack rpg akin to god of war with a pinch of soul mechanics sprinkled in. The world is gorgeously detailed with a multitude of biomes. From lush green forests, to dry sandy deserts, sparkling snow, each filled with Buddhist iconography. Temples temples temples you will see eye popping temples devoutly crafted to the smallest detail, I can feel the Buddha watch over me as my monkey cheeks gets clapped by the next monstrous abomination.As you progress further into the game many of Wukong’s legendary abilities are earned through a multitude of challenges and secrets. Secrets you might ask? Yes secrets, this game has secrets scattered in like a Bob Ross scattering happy little trees into his painting. Now we are going into a con with the game. The levels are beautiful, but they are linear with constant invisible walls blocking your movement. As a matter of fact there is an unstuck button within your menu that you can use to get yourself out, if you are stuck between an asset such as a tree and an invisible wall. Unfortunately my monkey was in that same situation, but with the added bonus within a boss arena. So my poor monkey had to take the pounding. As you journey throughout the map you start to question whether a path you can take or an invisible wall. This will cause a player to miss a significant portion of secret locations or quests they can take on. That is the only major con to me as a player, other than that, I will continue to gush over the game.Such as the BOSSES. Oh yes, the bosses have so much variety. From slippery adversaries trying to smack me side to side. To slow moving bruisers with a single hit sending me to home run. Out of all the bosses only one boss has one unfair mechanic, where you are forced to take damage. The combat is standard press light attack, press heavy attack when opening, dodge, and use spells depending on your resource bar. There are no combos like light light heavy or heavy light light etc. It is more bare bones, but very polished, each perfect dodge a sound will pop indicating you dodged at the last possible second. Truly a neuron activation moment.Your efforts throughout the game will be dutifully rewarded with beautiful animation cut scenes at the end of each chapter. Black Myth Wukong is something done so well with so much passion from the developers you can feel their excitement for the source material with every sight and sound.

10718,"TLDR:Not a game that regular gamer would enjoy. Here is what I feel after playing it after a long time. I am still at chapter 4.Let me start what I like about this game:1. Graphic: Amazing2. Character design: Amazing. I read the whole Journey to the west book when I was a child, and this is exactly how I would like those characters looks like in real life.3. Sound/Music: Some familiar songs from the early TV show I watched from child. Other musics are also god tier.4. The short anime after each chapter: It touches me each anime after the chapter. It was also a surprise that the fox is actually in chapter 3.Now lets talk about why exactly I do not like this game, even though I read the whole story from childhood and I am a fan of the story.1. Battle system: There is a huge, I mean HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE period of time (sorry not sure what the term it should be, but you got me) after you got attacked. It feels so helpless after get attacked even by a regular enemy and so annoying. Often time if you got several enemies around you, you are dead and you cannot even do a thing but only let it happen. It annoys me so much that I cannot bear it any more. This is essentially what makes the game not even enjoyable anymore.3. Boss bit box: Not sure why, but some boss has weird bit box, some critical shots got missed for no reason and you can die because of the bug. It makes the game so frustrating.4: Camera: The camera, and how it locks on enemy is killing me. It is so stupid (sorry I have to use this word) that it suddenly change the focus to some other enemy when I tried to land my heavy attack on low health enemy. It turned it around simply because of this weird logic of focusing. It aslo focuses on a spot of the boss, where is too far for you to reach, so you cannot deal dmg and just got beaten to the ground.5. Enemy design: It is so hard to tell which enemy is strong vs weak. You can get killed by 3 attacks randomly by a new enemy, or 1/100 of your health by other enemy characters. It is so random and annoying.6: Bugs: so many tiny bugs around.the map. I often got stuck in a weird corner, or by a tree branch that I suppose to jump over so easily. At least visually it looks like so.7. Fun to play: after hours of play, it feels the content, bosses, the way to play is always the same, it gets more and more boring after longer play.Conclusion:I was so excited about this ""first AAA"" game from my home town. I am sad that it annoys me more than surprise and gives me joy to explore the world, or play as Wukong.

10737,"It's a beautiful game. Almost anytime you enter a new area or turn a corner stop and take a look. The way the artists set up every area is like stepping into a painting. The gameplay is fun, a lot of constant upgrades will keep you engaged but the progression is not grindy at all. You will naturally get enough xp/money drops to get what you want.You can respec at any time for free, there are 3 different attack stances and a variety of different spells you can swap in or out depending on what playstyle you enjoy.There are a handful of side quests in each of the 6 acts that usually lead to a secret area with an epic optional boss. Every quest feels well written and based off some ancient Chinese story, this makes the writing feel authentic and strangely fresh to me as a westerner. The story doesn't feel vague like a souls game or Elden Ring and nothing feels like filler to get you to pump your playtime up. Everything feels substantial and interesting. The rewards from quests are nice but are eclipsed by the story itself which feels rare in 2024.This game doesn't feel stupidly hard. I had maybe 5-7 of the bosses throughout the game that made me attempt them more than 10 times. The average bosses were 1-3 attempts. I felt strong the whole game like a hero until I got my ass beat by one of the big guys. There are a few bosses that almost require finding a special item or strategy to make them feel fair but these were few and far between and the game guides you to the answer. I really enjoyed the most difficult bosses the most and kind of wish they would have made a few upgrades to the easier ones. Overall the difficulty is between Souls and God of war.The game left me feeling satisfied, there was nothing I got really frustrated with even after my 20th attempt on a specific boss (you'll know), the story wrapped up nicely experiencing the different endings without needing to NG+ and I'm really happy I got to experience Buddhist legend and culture through this game as a medium.Is it the best game I've ever played? Nope but it's the best game I've played in a long time and I think so far it's an easy GOTY for 2024. Excellent production value, beautiful, fun, and a story that made me want to keep coming back to see how it ends.8.8/10",Recommended,1843,53.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10749,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWESOME. This game might be my favorite game of all time. For some context i always wanted to get into souls games like elden ring for a LOOOOONG time but i was wAAAAAY to intimidated and thought i would just die and die and die and not have fun. Dont get me wrong i did die and die and die i just had fun. Anyways when i heard the hype around this game i finaly said i was going to do it because this game had everything i liked about the games i enjoyed before but interegated souls like difficulty. Now i know this is not a souls like but it was close enough for me after beating the game with the true ending i invested in another crabs treasure great game btw just beat that and i now am heading into my elden ring playthrough all because of this game. It taught me that failure is good and can be a lot of fun to think about how to kill stupid bosses like whiteclad ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damn noble.

I recommend Better Dodge from Nexus for anyone having trouble, because its worth completing and the mod still lets you play, making the bosses easier and more tolerable. Don't think it has the replayability of EldenRing, since there really aren't different styles to play. More variety in the 3 stances would have made it MUCH better as well as a map. Very tough to remember your bearings, since there's no North or any way to track where you've been besides empty chests. Still a great game.",Recommended,542,68.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10760,"It blows my mind how Game Science went from making a mobile game and a PvP strategy game to this. The quality and level of polish is unreal. The amount of love and care poured into this game is palpable. The visuals are awesome (though hard to run), the music is awesome, the character and enemy animations are awesome, the chapter end animations are also awesome, the art direction is awesome, and I could probably name plenty more awesome things if I thought about it a little more.The negatives. IMO I think there are some clearly defined negatives that most would agree on. The prevalence of invisible walls is not only disappointing but also flat out jarring in how much it interrupts your gameplay. I would also say that the melee combat leaves a lot to be desired. While it physically feels really good, 99% of the time will be you mashing light attack. There's a decent amount of variation in the skills to break up the monotony of it, although not nearly as many as you would think. There could be some subjective negatives regarding difficulty (or lack thereof) and the story (or lack thereof) and some other things, but I mainly wanted to point out somethings that most would agree could have been improved upon.Overall, Black Myth: Wukong was a great Journey that genuinely surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. I was hyped for this game from day one, but the more I saw gameplay and the more time it took and other games got released, I started to think that there was no way that this game would be as good as it looked, but here we are. If you're looking for a polished, moderately difficult, interesting, and fun passion project of a single player action game about a monkey destined for greatness, you should 100% give this game a chance.

10766,"This game is an impressive achievement, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it. However, I was taken aback by its extreme difficulty. I found myself spending countless hours battling a single boss and leveling up, often turning to YouTube for walkthroughs when I felt lost or confused.As someone who appreciates single-player games where I can relax with some snacks and enjoy the narrative, I must emphasize that this game does not offer that experience. Instead, it can lead to frustration and make you question your motivation for playing.If you are a hardcore gamer who thrives on challenging gameplay, this title is undoubtedly for you. However, I would advise casual gamers or those seeking a more leisurely experience to approach with caution.In summary, while I do have some regrets about my investment, I ultimately view it as a valuable experience, especially now that I have completed it. I recommend it, but be mindful of your gaming preferences—this isn’t a title like ""The Last of Us"" or ""Red Dead Redemption 2""; it’s a challenging endeavor that can induce quite a bit of stress.",Recommended,920,20.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

I get the appeal like oh its ""difficult"" and you want to prove to yourself that you can beat it... of course you can given enough reattempts through trial and error.The ""Souls like"" genre simply doesn't respect your time in my opinion.Overall though the game is not bad if your into souls like games where the point is to waste your time learning each boss by dying multiple times just to learn the bosses kit and the immediately thrown into another boss not even 10 min later just to rinse and repeat learning the bosses kit. (sometimes you might beat a boss on the first try too which is nice change of pace)I'm only leaving a positive review because the game is actually not bad but it truly assumes you already know how to play the game right when you start which is crazy in my opinion...Just be ready to feel like your wasting your time half the time playing the game... if your into that sorta thing.",Recommended,884,19.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

Gameplay has been very good and feels responsive, the only negative things I have to say about it is that some button queues such as using items like healing does not feel reactive as it has a bit of a delay or even sometimes doesn't work at all and exploration could've been more open instead of hitting those invisible walls. It's not super hard but it's not the easiest and the game makes a point of make you remember that on some bosses.The enemy design feels very varied and every boss feels different from each other besides a few repeats, it throws you at so many bosses that you will always be entertained and not feel bored at all, the game ends on a high note leaving you wanting more.

10831,"It's a visually striking game, with fantastic designs, model, and texture work throughout. Environments, and water especially is just top notch. Bosses are varied, levels have lots of space to explore, and the story is great. The music and songs are also very good, and there are animated intermissions in different styles!My only issue is level design. The number of one-way traversals is just too great, with no shortcuts or even regular backtracking: often your only way to get to the earlier location is to fast travel, which is a bummer. Also, the last chapter is just too huge to the point of being needlessly intimidating. I understand why it is the way it is, but again, with better level design, you could've made it clearer where the points of interest are. At least there's only one chest to find.Also, some collectibles are random drops, and there's only one item that increases the chance very slightly, so that's annoying. And, of course, the system requirements for the best visual quality is extremely high, but it's not here, nor there.",Recommended,875,45.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10847,"Wukong is an okay game. The only thing that keeps this game from being a great game is the exploration. I wish the game has maps. I'm okay with invisible walls but it really gets annoying. When an area opens up, it's easy to get lost. Yes, there are lots of resources online but it breaks immersion especially in a beautiful game like this. Rarely does a game stops you moving on so you can admire a scene. In terms of difficulty, it's very challenging.I had more challenge here than the Elden Ring DLC. There's no farming levels just to beat hard opponents like other Souls games. You really have to ""gitgud"". If I am to compare, Wukong is very much like Sekiro (I love this game). Amazing combat and flow. Enemy variety is top notch. While most of the bosses are easy, some really kicks your ass (Yellow Loong, I'm looking at you).Overall, again, this game is OK. Maybe I'll get achievements one day but not having a map sometimes really kill the enjoyment. I would give it a solid 8 out of 10.",Recommended,812,57.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

I had friends that got stomped by Erlang, I beat in on try #2 - but it also took me 15+ tries on the final boss, just couldn't get the timing. Went through NG+1 and had no need to play further.Graphics 9/10Story 8/10 (though the lore is incredible if you know the OG story)Gameplay 8.5/10Audio 9/10Overall MONKE/10 easily one of the best action games in years.

It's missing something...it has a distinct lack of innovative puzzles or problem solving and is really just a fancy boss rush. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but the challenge is in shuffling around spells, skills, soaks, curios, etc. for ""challenging"" fights, which I personally found a bit tedious.This game also has an enormous amount of invisible walls for a game in 2024.I find it an interesting choice to make a game about a monkey and decide not to let the monkey climb.Wait for this to go on steep sale and snatch it up then - especially if you need a break from a real souls game.",Recommended,589,86.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

This may seem like it's really easy but I'll tell you I have had to shuffle the points around to deal with bosses. Speaking of which The bosses are balanced, They are challenging but they don't one shot you unless you get hit by a big attack and I mean an attack that you should be able to see from a mile away.The best way I can put it is if you want to play a soulsborne but you don't want to deal with losing all of your progress repeatedly go for Wukong.Pros:visualscontrolsskill systemfocus systemforgivingCons:linearsome areas that look like you can get to might be invisible walled.8.5/10",Recommended,804,21.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

There's so many cool abilities and moves to unlock and they all feel badass to execute. Every magic power has it's use and you'll need them because this game is pretty tough.There's mechanics inspired by Dark Souls but the combat feels more similar to hack n slash games like Devil May Cry or the old school God Of War games, it's fast and frantic whereas the Souls games are more deliberate. I didn't do much research on the game before buying other than knowing it's a monke-like so this was really surprising and cool.Everything feels so slick and nice to control, i don't really have many complaints.I have so much more to do in the game but i'm already convinced that this is definitely one of the best games of the year.Also a big budget AAA game which released with no game breaking bugs, microtransactions or dumbass agenda other than letting you play as a superhero monke man?You're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right mate!",Recommended,910,65.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

The story is just beginning to unfold, and I hope it can be a story that isn't overly sentimental."" However, aside from the widely criticized small map, invisible walls, some drop rates, and the unreasonable multi-playthrough materials/progression, I personally feel that the most impactful issue is the graphics settings. The game's default depth of field/sharpening/lighting in many scenes is quite unsatisfactory and not eye-friendly, and the developers haven't provided any setting options. Additionally, the mouse key settings are too simplistic (no side buttons setting). I hope these can be optimized in future updates.",Recommended,808,116.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 19

10958,"I have not experienced this many nonsensical invisible walls in a game since from the ps2 era.Certainly they will understand, in future releases, that this has to be managed in a less akward way. See what God of war did. For example.I played for a while, wasn't sure if I wanted to blow past my viable refund time so I watched a few parts of longer playthroughs and, to me, it's seems like the gameplay loop is waaaay less interesting skillbased wise and much, much more buttonmashy.I get it.Now the low skill players have got their Soulsborne too. Fine. Not for me.Also not impressed by the level design. Pretty much one huge asset dump if you ask me.Very little work done on the textres. Just basic, plain, unworn, unstorytelling, unalive if you ask me.Yes, naughty dog are the masters of this but even if you lower the bar there is still a hell of a lot of work missing here in this aspect.Gold is gold, steel is steel , wood is wood and that is just about all there is to see here.Very bland.",Not Recommended,813,0.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 18

10969,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning and culturally rich action RPG that draws heavily from the classic Chinese novel, Journey to the West. The game excels in delivering a story steeped in Chinese mythology, bringing characters like Sun Wukong to life with incredible detail and authenticity. Each chapter of the game is a self-contained story, beautifully animated in various art styles, which adds a unique charm and depth to the narrative.The cultural elements are not just surface-level; they are deeply integrated into the gameplay and world-building. From the intricate designs of the characters and environments to the mythological references, the game offers an immersive experience that feels both educational and entertaining.In terms of gameplay, Black Myth: Wukong shines with its challenging combat system. The game is reminiscent of Soulslike titles, demanding precision and strategy from players. The boss fights are particularly noteworthy, offering intense and satisfying challenges that test your skills and patience. The use of the legendary staff from the novel as the primary weapon adds a layer of authenticity and connection to the source materialOverall, Black Myth: Wukong is a remarkable blend of storytelling, cultural homage, and engaging gameplay.

But once you get into the groove, it becomes incredibly rewarding.The transformations and abilities, like the To Get A Pluck of Many cloning spell and Cloud Step, are game-changers, making even the toughest bosses manageable.

EVERYTHING feels perfect.I know theres a debate going on about this game being a souls-like or not. The dev said its not a souls like, but to be honest, it plays like a souls-like but not as hard and more forgiving. I would say in terms of difficulty if we put Elden Ring at 10, this game's difficulty might be around high 6 or low 7. The boss fight are balanced, fun, and feels fair. Even for a gank fight, it feels more like a 1v1 rather than 2v1.Not to mention, the ending is definitely on the very top list of the best ending ever (true ending). The build up, the cinematics, the OST, and even the boss fight itself is one of the best ive ever seen and played. I literally have goosebumps all over me when playing the ending sequence.I definitely give this game a 10/10.

11059,"The game is fine, good even, but the combat system is really boring after a while. On the surface there are a lot of different spells and skills, but the basic combat boils down to smashing the light-attack button and dodging after a couple of hits. This is super frustrating with enemies that wont stagger nearly ever, and have 2 minute long combos where you just need to keep dodgerolling and cant afford to land a hit meanwhile. After the combo is over, get it a couple of hits and rinse and repeat. Yeah, most enemies are not like that, but oh boy, most bosses really like to play like this. Sure, you could use your spells and stuff, but that costs mana, and you dont have mana potions in this game. Its stupid. There is a very convoluted way to parry, but it still sucks. The later bosses and mobs are just frustrating to battle and not fun at all. Its not even about the difficulty in it self, most boss designs are just bad.I beat Erlang and got the ""secret ending"". I beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, even tho I didnt collect every little ♥♥♥♥ there is. Erlang being the hardest boss is also the most frustrating one. This boss is the epitome of ♥♥♥♥ boss-design. Combos that take forever half the time him being in the air out of reach. After beating him I was just glad it was over. Didnt feel good to overcome a challenge, like most Souls games bosses. No real sense of accomplishment, just a sigh.Yes its good that this game exists. There is no ""live service"" bs or anything else. Just a complete game. This is the direction games need to go back.

The game is completely linear, the levels are separated and there is only one main path and a few dead ends, plus one secret area per level with 15min of content plus a boss.Gameplay wise it's good, not perfect, not bad, but good. For me as someone who likes to master a combat system it wasn't optimal, I mean the game wants to be exciting and varied by having a lot of gimmiky spells but the basic combat is kind of monotonous and the fancy stick and jump animations make it hard to see what's actually happening so it's harder to be precise in combat. By precise I mean that in Dark Souls or Sekiro you can always see exactly how long the animation will take, and you can be very precise with your inputs, so you can beat really difficult bosses with skill. But Wukong isn't that precise, so the iframes and the amount of damage you get are tailored to that, so it kind of felt like I was beating the bosses more by luck than skill, it doesn't feel as rewarding as a Souls boss, but it was still fun.The story is kind of OK, you actually need to know journey to west to understand anything. It tries to be as mysterious as Dark Souls, but it lacks atmosphere. That doesn't mean it's bad, I enjoyed the story but I know journey to west a bit and still I didn't really understand what was going on but it still fun.Would I recommend the game, sure it's a nice linear early 2010s hack and slash with nice graphics, perfect for a relaxing Sunday.

Every input feels super responsive and the game supports a respectably diverse yet not overwhelming selection of fighting styles to toggle between. Additionally the boss variety, quantity, and quality are unequivocally unmatched. No other game comes close.

11152,"This game is far from perfect. It's clearly a first attempt at a very intricately designed game, from a company that generally creates cell phone games. Why? The strangest decision made during the development of this game (and I'm sure there are a few) is the choice to have invisible walls everywhere!? Why? If you can see an area you should be able to go to that area, or there should be a natural boundary which clearly indicates you cannot pass. Having invisible walls lining every inch of the map ensures that players will aimlessly wonder around, pushing the boundaries until they find yet another invisible wall. That's just one of the many negatives. The story line is yet another... Who the hell is this monkey? He isn't even Wukong? In the second chapter you appear with arrows all over your chest, yet zero explanation?However! The bosses are what makes this game what it is. You will find yourself making attempt after attempt to defeat very difficult bosses. It's both rewarding and addictive. The visuals are amazing despite the invisible walls. Sadly, it seems there's no thought concerning when players will require more health. You will get into situations where you just defeated a boss.... and yet you're supposed to fight again with no mana and no health. This requires some backtracking at times.Overall this is a damn good effort for a first game of this type from this creator. I can only imagine how good a sequel to this could be. PLEASE if anyone actually reads this.... Consider removing the invisible walls! If you jump into a hole you should die.... not be stopped. This leaves players constantly wondering if there's an area they missed, simply because they didn't walk around in literal circles trying to find every invisible nook and cranny on the map.And finally.... Tell me at the beginning that if I jump and then heavy attack I jump MUCH higher! Also, tell me that after I jump I can land a light attack and a heavy attack BEFORE landing! The timing... You literally have to dodge a full second before you would in any other game. If you dodge perfectly in time with the incoming attack you will get hit every time!Good Effort, 6.5 out of 10.I'd rate Ghosts of Tsushima a strong 9. It's close to perfect. This game can take some notes from Ghost and really, truly shine.

11187,Game Science poured so much love into this game.The final boss is one of the coolest fight in gaming. Definitely 10/10.Deserve to win game of the year.,Recommended,125,57.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 18
11188,"First thing's first, the game is gorgeous. It has the best trees, mountains, and sky I've ever seen in a video game- truly, it is art in its highest form. The lighting, the shading- everything is beautiful. There are some cattywompus effect tearings at a distance, but otherwise the game is immaculate.So far, the game has not been difficult, only sometimes frustrating. I'm going to continue since I can't refund the game at this point, and hopefully I'll begin to enjoy it more, but as it stands, it's difficult to recommend at full price. I would say this is closer to a $40 game.I just finished the first chapter, and I've gotta say, for some reason, so far, I'm not enjoying the game, and I think it's because of the combat. Everything feels so...floaty; and the hitboxes are kind of jank. Snake-man's only hurtbox is his torso- his long tail doesn't have one. When you're fighting a giant frog or wolf, or a bear the size of a small building, or a 10 ft statue, you would expect them to have weight. If they move fast, they would probably have some wind-up before, or wind-down after- but no. A powerful attack comes and goes just as fast, and the movement in their models carry no inertia. More often than not, they're zipping and soaring through the small arena without any follow-through, before then sweeping next to you with a wimpy multi-hit attack that you can just roll or jump out of the way of.Perfect dodges are a great addition to the roll mechanic, but sometimes feel like they can only trigger retroactively for some reason. It's probably a skill issue on my part, but I just can't seem to consistently trigger them. I trigger them a lot, probably almost least 40% of the time, but the % of times they've been on purpose is lower than I would like to admit. Roll 1 frame before the impact and it's just a regular dodge. 1 frame too late and you're hit/staggered.The enemy staggers aren't dynamic, so even if you attack them from behind, they're gonna fall backwards over you, and displace your character. It's not a major issue, it just makes the fight look/feel cheap.Enemies with any mist effect is going to sweep through into you, but their attack-boxes almost always feel a little too wide for the animation.The range of some boss's attacks are also anyone's guess, since they have 0 tell until it occurs. They'll have an animation showing them doing something, but you'll need to keep your distance, at least 50 ft away, otherwise you might get hit by an invisible force for half of your health.Almost all bosses have delayed attacks. I don't always mind that, I have over 300 hrs in Elden Ring, but something else is off about the enemy movement that makes the attacks worse. Some bosses track you a little too strongly, or get staggered lightly on the first hit, but not after, or almost always jump in a little-too-wide of a sweeping motion for the initial lift-off animation. Things that make you think ""Hmm, that was...questionable.""There's no animation cancelling, which is fine; that just means combat has intent-- except since a light attack chain takes ~6 consecutive seconds of follow-through, and bosses only stagger for ~2 seconds before they begin a 10 second long combo, you're left with a hit-and-run strategy since your third light attack's animation in the chain lasts 2 or 3 seconds, and the game queues button presses. If you get stuck in that animation by accident, or because a boss got staggered lightly then recuperates, you're guaranteed to lose health from hitting your attack button one-too-many times, even before your character has reached that third hit.I also haven't even mentioned the fact that, because of most enemy's strong tracking, even if you're behind them while they're in the middle of an attack combo, they'll occasionally spin around on a 180 swivel to hit you, instead of having a separate animation for different player positions that would make anatomical sense. Except for the frog. The back-kick on those got me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up the first time I saw that lol.The invisible walls also really suck sometimes, and there's a lot of them. For instance, your character has an animation for stopping right before a cliff edge to regain his balance, except the game won't actually let you fall or jump off. There are small little sections where it would be more efficient to jump over a cliff, or down, but the game puts invisible walls in some of the dumbest spots, like before a cliff with a 4ft drop, or the top of one rock and not another.All in all, the game is...fine, but there are just so many issues I have with it that I can't seem to enjoy playing it. I know a lot of people enjoy it, and the shining reviews definitely show it, but I don't. =(",Recommended,3883,5.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 18

11209,"Garbage Timer Gated piece of ♥♥♥♥ game. Glorified Unreal Engine Graphics Demo with about 30% of a game put in the middle of constant timer gated seriously stupid boss fights. Combat is stale and boring by the third level. Equipment is trash and does literally nothing for you for anything that approches fair play. Potions? Timered. Dodging? Timered. Take one step? Timered. Beyond bad.That and the amazingly blurry graphics of the new cinematic unreal engine games that come out for a one size fits all, so im forced to accept the crap the industry doesnt want to innovate for. Spent over 3 hours modding this piece of ♥♥♥♥ just to play this? Literally all levels are Asian mythological themes w/ different biomes. 1 lvl = Asian mythology with trees. Second with sand and third with snow. Etc etc. Snoozefest by the third level.Fights literally give me no incentive to care about dodging as there are no rewards. No counter attacks, no executions attacks, no critical hit attacks, no real interesting combos as you cannot spam spells because of this timer gated piece of trash, and nothing to keep me interested in doing perfect dodges. Like thats all you do is perfect dodge and then maybe 2-3 light hits for 3% of the bosses health then rinse and repeat. Then all you get is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon, armor, crappy transformation, or something else you dont care about. I got one transformation from a boss i fought for over 10 rounds just to do NO DAMAGE per hit when transformed because im not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ built into EVERY SINGLE skill tree! Transformations should literally be easier to upgrade than that. Its a totally broken part of the game. They entirely suck to use in any case.If youre a timered type of gamer and you think that means anything real, please do buy this game.

The only part that made an exception was the prison. But other than that, you were constantly blocked from jumping somewhere bc of walls.Some parts of the map looked like a path would guide you somewhere, only to be blocked by a wall.Why not put something there (like a fallen tree or an object) that would explain why you can't go there but still keep the view. It sometimes looks like an open-world game without being one.Let me be stupid and fall off cliffs. Let me jump from one place to another. If I don't make it and die, that was my choice. But being blocked by a wall (even tho you totally could make that jump) is frustrating.Other than that I really liked the game.

11292,"The main reason I am leaving a negative review is to help balance the positive review bombing. This game is fun for the most part but has quite a few flaws that doesn't really earn it 95% positive reviews. For all the good the game does, the games that it took inspiration from do all the ideas Wukong does but better. Plus in a couple of chapters it suffers from the modern idea that big open areas that are relatively empty equals fun.While the combat shines in a few fights for the most part it gets repetitive and eventually boring. It gives the player a lot of tools to work with but eventually you come to the realization that your basic attacks are pretty much the best way to approach 90% of fights in the game.I have only a surface level knowledge of Journey to the West so there were a lot of things story wise I didn't really understand. However, the between chapter cut scenes are pretty much works of art in their own right. Would love to see this studio make a movie or series.All in all pick this up if your itching for a slightly above average action game. But if you haven't played God of War (2018), Nioh, or Dark Souls go play them first they're just better games overall that Wukong draws heavy influence from. 7.5/10.",Not Recommended,1008,43.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 18
11293,"The arts and graphics are just impressive, no complains on that parts at all. I also love to see that many Chinese culture elements presented in the game, which you can tell the makers really put hearts on making it.However, the map design especially the air walls are really the worst and affects the game experience so much. Which makes me wanted to quit the game so many times.The skill tree system is cool but the level design that you almost have one boss after another makes the growth of the character less interesting.For the arts, this is a game I'd definitely recommend to everyone that are interested in Chinese culture. But for the gameplay - I am not quite so sure. Hope they will make their next game much better.",Recommended,597,11.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 18

Lots of choices to be made while exploring the detailed - albeit limited - maps, and even more choices to be made in combat. Outstanding music and theatrics, especially for some key bosses, and the animated cutscenes after each chapter are all extremely interesting. Beyond small issues like lack of a map, an abundance of invisible walls in unexpected places, and a relative lack of guidance compared to its competitors, the game is very well polished and is worth the price.",Recommended,478,35.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 18
11330,Product received for freeAs someone with a very short attention span this game got me hooked for longer than almost any game I played cept for a few. Set difficulty makes this a challenge for sure especially for rookie gamer like moi but my god is it ever fun. Insane visuals even more so than what I would've expected from a modern AAA game and the quirky/unique animations for each story added an additional charm. Personally I like the pacing of this game and the well spaced check points make the game immersive but also easy on my time as I can stop almost anytime I want without having to worry about losing any progress. No auto-save demons in my head haunting me every 5 minutes help a ton as well.Loved Journey to the West growing up and this game depicts the most bad-ass version of Wukong to date.

11349,"So, I've 100% this game. What can I sayTook me around 80 hours to do that, while the game itself took me around 60-65, but you can be sure I took my damn time and explored.Honestly, the game exceeded my expectations, gameplay wise, story wise, it's art and concept as a whole.I do not believe western studios could release a game like this yet, I don't even want them to. I have to give big kudos to devs for giving us a fun game, but also giving us a beam into eastern mythology, inspired by one of my favorite literature pieces, Journey to the West.I will keep this reviews , but I also advise you to look up Sun Wukong and his story, because the game takes effect AFTER the events of Journey to the West. There are some deviations from the canon for plot purposes, but it's good to know the gist to understand some parts of the story being told, even the first sequence that you play. I am saying all of this, just to make your experience that much better.So.I'm actually pleasantly surprised how they captured essence of multiple games I love.Rest/Respawn as souls seriesStances as Ghost of TsushimaFlashy cinematic nature as GoW4 and RagnarokSnappy hack n slash combat as DmCCompiling all of these elements and executed at this level, they compliment each other and just.. Work.You can also use Transformations and turn into Spirits, which is a pretty cool element I like, sometimes can be OP. But that's the thing. Your enemies are aswell at times (I'll get to that in a bit), so why shouldn't you?Difficulty range is mid/high, prepare to struggle a bit, but the game expects you to adapt to situations, not just steamroll through. All abilities are REFUNDABLE, so don't be scared to change strategies and try something new. There are a handful hard bosses, but not to the levels of Souls series. About 3 bosses have a certain gimmick tied to first beating a secret area of a chapter, to obtain an item to help you with final bosses. But in general, all story bosses are Ok in difficulty. You won't be doing any 50+ attempt sit downs where a boss beats down all of your self confidence a leaves you with a strong urge to buy a rope. (I will not forget what you did Elden Ring DLC)Combat feels good and rewarding, 3 main play styles that allow you to experiment. BUT, as I said, don't get too comfortable, enemies especially later on can counter your tricks, so you will have to find a way to overcome their bs. Bosses are structured around you not abusing certain build, so It's good to get comfortable with as many mechanics as you can. I've played with every stance for 2 chapters, so I felt comfortable to switch any time. This way I beat most bosses in >5 attempts. Only one boss took me like 30+ attempts and another 10+ attempts (both are actually optional).Another element from Souls series, especially Elden Ring, that's here, is endless enemy combos. 8-10 chain hit attacks, like a damn ballerina hooked on angel dust spinning around you with no regard to your plans. ♥♥♥♥ my pants multiple times, did not lose a single controller though.One thing I don't like is the lack of a map and world constructed in a way, that has a lot of invisible walls in places that ''seem'' like paths and then some paths I wouldn't expect to go to at first glance. That pushes a player like me to explore and that cuts some of the immersion. This can also impact you in a sense of secret areas. Devs literally hid some of the best content in these secret areas and are like ''the ultra cool ♥♥♥♥ is there, but I don't care if you find it bozo LMAO''Like what. On one hand, that's based af, on another, I COULD'VE EASILY MISSED THAT?Even with the issue of no map and some weird terrain, this game is carried and excels through NUMEROUS bosses, 80+ actually, with almost all of them being totally different apart from 6 frogs, all fresh, all meat and potatoes, all action. Each chapter having new enemies, new elite enemies, new boss designs tied to chapter theme, just an absolute banger with variety.So easy 9/10Absolutely amazing story telling, each chapter has an animation as a reward and they are absolutely stunning. Each made by a different studio, telling stories, tying chapters up, even foreshadowing the next chapter that's coming. I'm glad gameplay wise they allow you to travel back to previous chapters, so you can finish remaining bosses and tie up loose ends. (won't elaborate further)As I stated, this is After the novel, so it's a new story with core material being displayed in full and with pride. I refuse to elaborate for you on anything, better if you experience it yourself, for me for this aspect.It's a 10/10.I could be nerd yapping about all of the amazing compositions with strong oriental roots and cultural music instruments, all you need to know is, it slaps and it slaps hard. Thematically crafted, well put together with map concepts that compliment each other and immerse you further into this mystical universe.Most of the music is on streaming platforms, apart from 1 I couldn't find.2 pieces went straight into my playlist, both from boss fights.My ears are very grateful and won't need a fresh climax for a while.Another easy 10/10Have you seen the trailers or gameplay footage?I will only add that I couldn't play on max and I have an expensive PC, so I will throw some shade as a tantrum, because I'm petty.8.5/10Oh boy. This one, was some pain. Not an extreme challenge, but there are about 5 achievements that are just... UGH. Farming. Just a bunch of farming. Some of that farming is enemy farming, but a lot of that farming is plants farming. How does that kind of farming work you ask?Let me explain;>you pick up materials as ingredients for potions>there are 15 different ingredients to pick and each have a corresponding seed>you need to farm ALL of those seeds for an achievement>some of those ingredients can also drop passive items>which you also need to get ALL for another achievement>for these drops, you have a small chance, that you can't augment>farming locations have around 3-6 spots for ingredients, so 3-6 chances for a drop>Do you know how many runs I had to do? The pain I suffered? Out of those 96 hours I spent in this game till this review, around 10-15 of those were achievement hunting, dying on the inside, sometimes thinking that I'm crazy, that the wiki is wrong, that the gods conspired on me to never get my 100%, but in the end, I got it.I refuse to rate this part, but it was Not my hardest 100%Game was an all around amazing experience, I don't give out 10/10 reviews, because I don't think a 10/10 game exists yet, but this one is high up there among my favorite games of all time and is an instant classic in my library. I really feel like this game is like if you gave an indie studio an infinite budget, for them to not hold back at all.It exceeded all my expectations, made me Rock Solid, brought me back to monke, made me emotional, further cultured my ahh and brought joy every time I escaped reality with this title.I also hear, that DLC is coming out in January next year as a part of Chinese New Years Celebration and I'm Rock Solid again as of mentioning this.",Recommended,5865,96.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 18

I’ve only put in around 7 hours, so I’m not too deep into the story yet, but it’s definitely grabbing my attention—especially with the whole Journey to the West inspiration.The game can be pretty challenging, which took me a bit to get used to, but I actually like that about it. The combat forces you to think and react carefully, and even though I’ve had some tough moments, it feels rewarding when I finally get through them.Overall, I’m having fun with it and looking forward to seeing how the story and gameplay develop as I go further.",Recommended,601,11.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

The fact that our character have long/slow attack animations that are, most of the time, not cancelable against quick bosses kills the fun. The game basically punish you for playing well with its timing counters. The timing counters are so slow and some bosses so quick that you take free damages while doing the counter attacks animations (big up to skyfall stryke, an attack supposed to be a very good reward after countering an ennemy attack, but ends up getting canceled by the tiger vanguard boss and is responsible for multiple of my deaths on others)In the end, I stop to struggle and first time bosses when I use a more cowardly play style which I repeat, kills the fun.",Not Recommended,874,6.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11455,"So it's time to talk to you about the game that so far has proven to meet all the requirements for this year's Game of the Year award, Black Myth: Wukong, which is an action RPG - Souls like game developed by Game Science, an independent studio from China, and is one of the top titles in the modern video game industry out there right now.Based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West (although the events of the game take place after the novel), it reimagines the legendary story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, through a new, impressively crafted and visually stunning narrative. The game has already captured the public's attention immediately from its very first day of release, with its stunning graphics, dynamic combat and original depiction of Chinese mythology.Our story literally begins in the clouds, at the end of an era. Sun Wukong, the iconic Monkey King, has just completed one of the most important missions of his historical life, successfully escorting the monk Tang Sanzang to the West and recovering the sacred Buddhist scriptures. This monumental achievement earned Sun Wukong a place among the Buddhas, granting him the coveted immortality. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Sun Wukong rejects this offer. Instead of embracing eternal life, he chooses to return to his mountain in search of peace and solitude.But peace is fleeting, especially when the gods are involved. The Celestial Court, the divine rulers of the heavens, are far from pleased with Sun Wukong's decision to disobey them. Enraged, the Court sends an army led by Erlang Shen, a skilled warrior, a demigod with 3 eyes, known for his incredible strength, his magical spells, and his knowledge of various weapons, particularly of the iconic three-pronged, double-edged sword of Sanjianliangrendao (I didn't get you, and yet that's what it's called) to deter him, and eventually after a tutorial battle, this is how our story begins.Firstly I want to say that you should experience the experience in Chinese, as I think it adds another touch to the whole experience of the setting. However, the most notable aspect of Black Myth: Wukong is its gorgeous and detailed graphics. Unreal Engine 5 provides excellent image quality, with each environment being full of detail and vibrancy. From lush, dense forests to ruined temples, the game brings the myth to life with an intensity that few other games can match. The visual effects, shadows and lighting are flawless, creating a world that feels as realistic as it is fairytale-like. The monsters and enemies that inhabit these environments are imaginatively designed and varied. Each enemy has its own identity, combining traditional elements of Chinese mythology with a modern, dark aesthetic. Sun Wukong, the main protagonist, is extremely well-drawn. The character's ability to shape-shift into various creatures not only offers strategic options in battles, but also a sense of exploration as the player discovers new abilities and forms, as his transformations are impeccably implemented both visually and functionally.The core of Black Myth: Wukong is dynamic combat. The game draws inspiration from well-known titles such as Dark Souls and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, offering a combat system that requires precision, strategic thinking and patience. The combat system is demanding and heavily reliant on the timing of attacks and evasions, creating a sense of tension in every battle, even in encounters with simple enemies. Ruyi Jingu Bang, Wukong's iconic staff, is another key element of the battles. The staff can expand and contract, offering the player a variety of distances and attack types. The movements are fluid and the animations are excellent, with attacks having weight and impact. In addition, the game offers rich character upgrades, with plenty of options to develop Wukong's skills and forms. This adds a satisfying degree of RPG depth, allowing the player to customize their play style to their liking.From the very first few minutes, Black Myth: Wukong delivers excellent performance, with impressively stable frame rates and a smooth experience even in demanding battle scenes (let alone with a 6-year-old GPU like mine, the 1080ti, playing at very high settings). Unreal Engine 5 delivers not only stunning visual effects but also excellent physics in the environment and character models. The enemy AI seems to be intelligent and adaptive, with different enemy types exhibiting unique behaviors. Boss battles, in particular, are quite complex, requiring players to learn attack move sets and find their weaknesses.Black Myth: Wukong's sound design is just as impressive as its graphics. The sounds of weapons, combat and environmental elements are well-curated and add realism to the player's experience. Environmental sounds, such as the wind blowing away leaves, add to the sense that the world is alive. Battle sounds are resonant and deep, adding a sense of gravitas to clashes with enemies, while the sounds of Wukong's transformations heighten the sense of magic. In addition, the musical score is inspired by traditional Chinese instruments such as the guzheng and erhu, creating an atmosphere that brings the player closer to Chinese culture and mythology. This traditional music is seamlessly combined with more contemporary instrumental compositions, enhancing the battles and cinematic scenes. Each area of the game seems to have its own sonic identity, creating a complete experience for the player.One of the most important aspects of Black Myth: Wukong in my opinion, is the fact that it was developed by a relatively small studio, Game Science, which has nevertheless managed to create a game that rivals major productions from well-known companies. This demonstrates the potential of independent game development, and Black Myth: Wukong can become a model for how independent studios can create titles that are competitive on an international level. That is, after all, the essence of video games, to provide quality, fun and sometimes even learning, leaving aside tactics that consume the magic of gaming and are condemned by the public.To sum up, I want to say that I highly recommend the game, as I believe Black Myth: Wukong is one of the best games of the last decade, combining high quality graphics, challenging gameplay and deep narrative themes. With its technical excellence, intricate combat and unique approach to mythology, it has all the makings of being a landmark in the action RPG category and games in general. Game Science has managed to combine rich storytelling with engaging gameplay, Black Myth: Wukong is one of the most memorable games of its generation. Finally, with its depth and variety of worlds, impressive transformations, and thrilling epic battles, the game has captured the attention of both action RPG fans and avid gamers who don't have the slightest idea about action RPGs in general.In closing, I'll share with you one last thing, I haven't found any flaws in this game, but because I'm a harsh critic with the gaming industry in general, I won't give it an absolute 10 (although it clearly deserves it). An absolute 10 for me is a game that will literally get me excited, like only one title has done in the past that I might one day 'fix' and tell you about.Rating 9.5/10",Recommended,6133,29.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

I’m mainly doing this to extend my playtime because I really enjoy the game and exploring each chapter. I’m taking off 1 point because, to me, the game felt a bit easy. Only Tiger Vanguard and Yellow Loong gave me any real challenge, for Erlang i have no comment i just beat it in second try, maybe it’s because I approach it like I do in Elden Ring, exploring the whole map before fighting bosses.Another issue is that the hitboxes for the huge bosses, like the Scorpion Lord, feel unoptimized—it's just frustrating at times. Also, the replayability doesn’t quite hit the mark for me. Overall, it’s still a pretty good game..",Recommended,599,52.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

Very well balanced, there was no need to grind for level, leveling progression was good and balanced. The game only got better as I progressed.Huge variety of builds and combat styles. Although no difficulty setting but there are varieties of different builds with skills trees, abilities, spells, gears, spirits, medicines, and upgrades that can make the game easier or harder. The game let the gamer to decide the difficult within the game. Spark (skill) points can be reallocated freely at any shrines, so you can try out different builds. Some builds are bad or good against certain bosses which can make the fight much easier or harder.The game is full of surprises. Always something new in each chapter.There are a lot of mini and major bosses, and they are all unique. Very fund boss fights.It’s not open world.

11545,"The story of this game can be seen as a continuation of the traditional Chinese myth, *Journey to the West*. However, the charm of the game does not simply lie in its connection to ""traditional mythology."" In extending the mythological narrative, it cleverly uses elements from the original story to introduce (or perhaps construct?) a different side of the story—one that readers (or viewers) of the original work could not see. The transition is seamless and thought-provoking.For me, someone who was born and raised in China, who has been immersed in the story of *Journey to the West* and knows it inside out, the game offers a brand new perspective. Just like in the real world, we can never fully see the darker side behind the ""great, bright, and righteous"" image established by the ""heavenly court."" Life, like the game, mirrors this complexity. As we, like the protagonist, follow the path once trodden by Sun Wukong, seeing what he saw and doing what he did, we eventually come to realize and understand whether his world and his life were truly as bright and glorious as we have been led to believe.As Shakespeare once said: ""Men at some time are masters of their fates: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves that we are underlings.""",Recommended,1050,11.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11558,"It's been a long journey.132 hours sunk into a game that I had zero intentions on buying until I made a rash decision 4 hours before it released. I'm terrible at games like this. Once I realized in chapter 1 what this was going to be. I could've easily just given up but I didn't. There's no hand holding. No map. Only some mystical smoke leading you to the next checkpoint. The main character doesn't talk every 5 secs telling you where to go. You'll get lost. You may get stuck on a boss for 2 days. You'll get mad and you will most certainly die but it's completely worth it.The graphics are amazing. The artwork, level detail is sometimes a site to behold.Gameplay for me was solid.Performance. Crashed during shader comp. That was the only problem I had. No stutter or any issues that people have mentioned in the discussions. Ran 2560x1440 at a solid 60fps but would flux 90-118 when I had 120 selected. RT turned off and everything set to very high.The over sharpness I dealt with a simple fix. Turned it down on my monitor and in the Nvidia overlay, I turned it down to 18 and it was good.I don't know... I'm stoked that I beat this. Will definitely do NG+ run.For me it's a 10.

When I die, it feels like it's because i'm not playing well, as opposed to something unfair. There are definitely some bosses that you have to take your time with, and you can't just run in swinging or they'll destroy you every time.Edit: I'm now 50 hours into the game. I'm still not done with it yet since i'm trying to get everything and fight all the bosses. I can't recommend this game enough. I've enjoyed every minute of it, even the frustrating ones where I'm getting my butt handed to me by some crazy boss move.",Recommended,562,58.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 17
11575,"Honestly, Black Myth: Wukong is an amazing game, but it does have its share of flaws.Pros:-Absolutely gorgeous visuals. Like, if you can run this with raytracing, do it. You won't regret it.-Mostly fluid combat. Lots of spells and transformations to choose from, but honestly, only some of them are useful. Most of them will just sit there and never get used. I think I switched my transformation twice the whole game and never changed my spells.-Soundtrack was stellar. It's definitely understated in some areas, but when it takes center stage, it adds so much to the settings.-Bosses, for the most part, felt fair and were pretty fun to fight. They were also varied, though you do get some repeat bosses for upgrade materials and the like.-The characters all sounded and looked like...Humans. The ""human"" ones at least. North American devs could really take a page out of Game Science's book because I will forever compare how the characters in this game look better than anything that any of the American ""AAA"" studios have put out in a decade.Cons:-Invisible walls...Absolutely everywhere.-Boss hitboxes can be extremely wonky and can result in major headaches when fighting them. Especially if they start getting cheap shots in because of said hitboxes. To add to this, bosses in the late game start to rely heavily on grab attacks which ruin the pace of combat. Couple this with the wonky hitboxes (they're grabbing you when you're off to the side of them because you *did* in fact dodge) it just becomes annoying.-Chapter progression goes downhill very quickly in my opinion. The game starts incredibly strong, but each subsequent chapter felt worse and worse to me. Honestly, if they just got rid of Chapter 6, the game probably wouldn't have lost anything other than some already whack story.-At no point in the game do you ever feel as powerful as you probably should, which is fine because they're attempting to emulate a Souls-like game, but this isn't a Souls-like game. This follows more closely with God of War in the combat and exploration. The only thing even remotely Souls-like about this game is the difficulty, which can easily be circumvented because nearly every boss/enemy can just be cheesed or they have a specific item that nullifies their entire gimmick.-It really bothered me that you play as a monkey, but you legit cannot climb anything. That may be something that just bothers me in particular.-There's definitely some balance issues across the board. Some things are so weak they're worth absolutely nothing and other things are so powerful they trivialize the game.-Silent protagonist, because there legit could have been so, so, so, SO many good interactions if he actually spoke.Overall, I think Game Science did a magnificent job with Black Myth. I'm really looking forward to either a sequel or DLC at the least, which I'm pretty sure I've heard is already being worked on. If you can get past a few (and by that I mean VERY FEW) janky bosses, you'll enjoy your time with the game.As for play time, Steam says I clocked in 37.1 hours, but it was less than that for me to get through all of the main/secret/optional bosses (except for one because I didn't realize he just *wouldn't* be there if I progressed past the area). I'd say it probably took me 33-ish hours because I did let the game idle for a little while the other day. But, honestly, to pay 60 bucks (less than your average ""AAA"" game) and get about twice the amount of content out of it compared to any ""AAA"" game that has recently released, I'd say it's an easy buy, even at full price.",Recommended,2972,53.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11638,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a fantastic and challenging character action game. I immensely enjoyed my experience playing it and loved doing all of the optional chapter bosses to get the true ending! It was tough and there was a lot of shouting on my end, but it felt so satisfying besting all the bosses.The combat is tight and you gain a lot of abilities and spells throughout to spice up the gameplay. There's a sense of RPG game design here too because of the armor and weapon stats you can equip on the protagonist to make him fit the play-style you desire. I preferred putting all my points into the smash attack stance and doing crazy big raw damage. The upgrade trees are so large that the game is almost begging you to play it a second time just to unlock every ability.The graphics are phenomenal, simply put. Definitely invest in a 40 series graphics card for this one, you'll appreciate it so much more because the visuals are damn impressive. I played it on cinematic graphics and it constantly kept me in awe throughout every chapter. The game had a few issues for me with the linear branching sections becoming a bit confusing (I wish the game gave us a map), but overall I had so much fun with the combat and bosses that I can't even get too mad at the faults in the game design. The presentation is top notch and I loved the progression of feeling like my character was getting stronger after every boss battle.Getting into the game, I didn't know Chinese mythology that much so some of the story aspects were lost on me at first, but upon further research and YouTube videos, I was able to understand the much larger story at play. I highly recommend this game to anyone that needs that ""Sekiro"" itch scratched. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is very similar since it has boss battles that require patience and the necessity to learn attack patterns. I can't wait to see the future of this game through DLC expansions and I'm excited for whatever the developers do next! This is definitely going to snatch some awards this winter at The Game Awards and it definitely deserves them.",Recommended,1710,34.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11667,"If I could give a ""mixed feelings"" review, I would. But unfortunately that doesn't quite exist and the positives still mostly outweigh negatives in this game, so it gets a thumbs up for me.There's a lot of depth in the combat. Unfortunately, while it feels like you start off fairly weak, you quickly ramp up to be unstoppable and I would imagine I died more times in any of chapter 1/2 than 3-5 combined. Obviously you can deliberately un-learn skills and use ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear, but what's the fun in that?Level design in this game also leaves a lot to be desired, this is especially obvious in chapter 3's prison section and chapter 4's cave section, where navigating the world is an absolute nightmare. It got so bad in chapter 5 that it's almost a completely linear path, with one off-branch for the hidden area and one main branch (that you cannot deviate from at all!) for the story.Negatives aside, though, the graphics are fantastic! Even just walking between points of interest proves to be an absolute treat for my eyes. I'm told that the optimization is middling for a AAA game, but perhaps that's just the norm nowadays.Music is also great, lots of Chinese instruments used with a more traditional style, which somewhat deviates from what people might be used to. One strange gripe is that lots of minibosses have fantastic soundtracks associated with them, but they die so quickly that I get banger music for like a minute, and it's back to regular programming again.The voice-acting is great, but the story's pacing can be a bit hit or miss. I thought chapter 3 in particular was annoyingly long with confusing story, while chapter 4's story was fantastic and packed into a medium-length map.While IGN ♥♥♥♥♥ up a lot, I think they actually cooked with the 8/10 for Black Myth: Wukong. As the first AAA game that China produced, for it to even be compared with the greats like FromSoftware is very promising, hopefully this is the first of many many more to come.",Recommended,1627,39.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

The game boasts breathtaking visuals, showcasing diverse scenery and enemies alike. Its addictive combat system truly makes you feel like Wukong himself. And the masterful storytelling offers a deep, culturally rich tale.While it is true, if you know the source material this game is based off of: “Journey to the West”, you will notice numerous Easter eggs and references that build on existing lore, But it's certainly not required for you to enjoy the game to its full extent.Each chapter of the game tells a tale equally as captivating as the last. Filled with memorable boss fights with diverse mechanics that makes each battle a test of skill, giving us very rewarding progression. There are also many hidden side quests that weave back into the main storyline in surprising ways. So keep your eyes peeled at every corner!And that final boss of the game… wow, one of the most creative fights I've ever experienced. The amount of hidden lore and character journal entries will surely leave players eager to explore this world further.

It's a lot like Elden Ring except the UX makes like 10x more sense.I will say the main thing missing is a map.

11743,"Pros:unique looking characters and a world with great variety. Detailed models, cool effects that don't distract from the viewreadable and easy to use UIcontrols are responsive and smooth. Heavy attracks, magic and consumables can't be cancelled by design, pushing you into controlled combat instead of spamming attracksin order to perform heavy attacks, you will need to land some light attacks or perfect dodges to fill up your special meter. You can save multiple heavy attacks to perform special moves, depending on the stances you unlock. Stances can be improved and new moves can be unlocked within the selected stance. I'm glad that progression isn't just about increasing your attack or health points, there are also stat improvements. Good variety of magic that can change combat style, great synergy with regular attracks. Heavy attracks and magic need to be used with caution as they take time and enemies can punish bad timing. When defeating certain enemies you can get their power to use it for a small amount of timeprogression doesn't require grinding. You can rearrange upgrades and try something else if you get stuck. I almost never do this in other games, but some final bosses made me experimentthere are side quests that can unlock secret levelsmost of the regular enemies should be respected, you can rarely spam attacks and do not lose big amount of healthlarge number of bosses with different levels of difficulty. It's not a sweat fest, some bosses are just there for fun. Moves are readable and most (or all?) are dodgeable. There are other ways to avoid damage besides dodgingperformance is questionable, as the RTX 4070 TI Super with i7-12700KF in 1440p with all Ultra + Mid RT + DLSS 80% + frame generation gets 100-110 fps. RT seems to be necessary to get good lighting and shadows, but DLSS (and frame gen?) brings visual artefacts here and there. Also shader and traversal stutters, the shader stutter problem improves over time but is still annoying. Traversal stutter doesn't bother me that much if we can get less loading screens",Recommended,1722,66.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11746,"Black Myth: Wu Kong is a game that transcends the typical expectations of action RPGs. From the moment you begin, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary experience. The meticulous attention to detail in the combat mechanics is extraordinary, offering a perfect balance between strategic depth and fluid action. Each move feels deliberate, calculated, and meaningful, allowing players to execute their abilities with absolute precision.The narrative is equally impressive, blending myth and legend into a cohesive and compelling storyline. It challenges the player not only to adapt to new and increasingly difficult enemies but to reflect on the world and their role within it. The protagonist's journey, though fictional, offers a profound sense of empowerment, as every choice and action reverberates with purpose.Visually, Black Myth: Wu Kong is stunning. The environments are crafted with an eye for beauty and intricacy, immersing the player in a world that feels as real as it is mythical.

11747,"Black Myth Wukong is a fantastic Action hack and slash game. Combat can be a bit clunky at times but once you get used to it and know the timings of attacks and abilities it opens up and allows you to make some great plays while in combat.If you get this, you're getting this for the combat and the enemy variety not the story. The Destined One does not speak even though we hear Sun Wukong speak at the start of the game. Its a shame they went with a silent main character when Sun Wukong has such amazing and silly banter throughout the entirety of the story for Journey to the West. Without that here the story feels hollow, like its missing the core of Sun Wukong when we are supposed to be the reincarnation of him. I understand we are going on a quest to get the 6 relics that are pieces of Sun Wukong but the story doesn't make it feel like we are slowly becoming what we were after the starting events took place. the relics just feel like an other skill point tree to put the point in rather than unlocking something core of what make Wukong special. It would have been amazing if after we acquired the first relic we unlock his voice or something, but nope he just stays silent all the way to the end. The True ending was fantastic but honestly keeping the MC silent just hurt this game.The Boss fights are fun, all be on the easier side of things.

11772,"Gameplay and Boss Fights:The gameplay is incredibly fun, with most bosses offering a thrilling experience. A few are particularly challenging, even harder than hardest bosses in Souls games. The mobs are also well-designed. It's satisfying to get behind them, only to be surprised by a powerful counterattack that prevents cheap hits.Cinematic Brilliance and Soundtrack:Visually, this game is on another level. The cinematics are stunning, deeply emotional, and beautifully crafted—especially the mini films, with the last one being most touching. The soundtrack complements these moments perfectly, adding to the emotional depth and making certain scenes hit even harder.Minor Flaws:The game does have a few minor issues that may or may not bother players, depending on personal preference. For example, some areas require a long walk without a checkpoint, which can be frustrating. Another small gripe is the restrictive pathing—there are many places that look like you could explore or jump into, but invisible walls prevent it. One final gameplay-related issue I had was with the movement. When running, if you dodge or jump, Wukong's momentum breaks instead of flowing smoothly, which felt like a missed opportunity for more fluid gameplay.Biggest Flaw:In my opinion, the game's biggest shortcoming is its lack of a recap or introduction that explains the backstory for players unfamiliar with Journey to the West. Games like Devil May Cry 5 handle this well, offering a brief explanation at the beginning so new players aren’t lost. Without a similar feature, those who haven't read Journey to the West might miss out on fully appreciating the incredible characters. I've read it about 4 years ago and I forgot some things, but someone who didn't really know much about Wukong is unfamiliar with Zhu Bajie, they wouldn't grasp how awesome he is on first encounter, as his backstory with Wukong is only briefly touched on through dialogue and it is rather confusing just reading an attempt at making players remember something they didn't know in the first place. You could easily tell the target was the Chinese audience, but would have still been so much more if these important characters were better explained.",Recommended,1868,46.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11775,"i wanted to 100% this game before i review it and i am really glad i did because i had an absolute blast with itthis is an amazing game that completely shattered my expectations,if you think this is a souls like then you are halfy mistaken,it has soulslike elements in this game but it's more like the first third of it,this game feels like if we took the setting and the premise of god of war 3,mixing it with gameplay elements of god of war 2018 and then make the fights about 3.5 times harder than that game,so yes it's really pushing the bounds on the whole soulslike argument so the awnser is just somewhere between the lines (similar to games like ninja giden 2 sigma and the more advenced levels of difficulty of dmc3 for example).this game is also not a version of the journey to the west novel like many expected it to be,it's a continuation for the most popular character,so it would be better if you have any knowledge about what happened before(bc go read journey to the west).with all of that out of the way,if they somehow will manage to ♥♥♥♥ up the many releases of october this very might be game of the year for me,this game manages to tell an amazing about rebirth and in legacy inheritance all while also delivering on a very fun boss rush baffe experience.i had 3 playthroughs and got the secret ending in all of them(the canon and also the better ending out of the two)mainly because it lead to the secret and best boss fight in the game,erlang shen and the four havenly kings,this fight feels like something that jumped out of sekiro and made it to this game,the first part of the fight that is against erlang actually feels like a clash between gods and the second stage against the four heavenly kings feels like and all out brawl/massacre of gods,it's one of the best boss fights i've ever played it was a blast.the only problem i find in this game now is not the game itself,it's the state of it on pc,performance is not great at all and you already kinda need a monster nasa pc to even run it, and it's not because it's a very demanding game like crysis was back in the day but because the game just needed more time back in the oven to iron out the bugs and performence issues,the last time i talked about this was in my dead space remake review when it came out last year and already a few weeks after that game released they released patches that fixed it, so i hope game science can do this too even if they are not under a big studio umbrella of money like EA.I loved my time with black myth wokung,the story,the gameplay,the boss fights and i didn't even get to talk about the music tracks,this is almost a masterpiece due to the performence issues i stated eralier and some of the very few boss fights in the game with very bad game design(supreme inspector).8\10",Recommended,2280,77.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11792,"Wow what a game! Finished a playthrough in 38 hours and can honestly recommend this game to anyone who likes third person action games like darksouls and god of war.Now lets look at some POSITIVES:- The game is fully functional out of the box- The game is R 900 in South Africa which is literally like almost R 600 cheaper than a new call of duty or other AAA games.- I cannot speak for performance as I had no issues on 4k ultra with a RTX 4090 setup. There are however the dreadful stutter issues present that seems to be a trend in newer games.- No extra purchases or micro transactions. You pay upfront and get a full product out of the box that you can enjoy and it even includes NG+- Gorgeous looking game. Seriously some of the details that are in this world are mind blowing. I really appreciate the effort that the devs put into the environment and all the small details on things like temples and murals etc. Each chapter is beautiful and I swear they not only made each chapter a different ""biome"" due to the story but also just to show off how great their visuals are.- Building on the previous point I just want to highlight that FINALLY we have a game and devs that recognise that the one place where you do not want the textures to look bad is on the MAIN CHARACTER. I know this sounds obvious but i genuinely feel that there are recent games that cant grasp this concept (looking at you cod mw3). The destined one has an incredible model and each and every armour set in the game has really detailed designs and textures and this is very much appreciated!!!!!!- The combat is really fun and engaging and they did a good job to make the attacks feel impactfull. Bosses and enemies will react when getting hit by certain attacks like staggering when hit with a heavy attack etc. Also I love that the game establishes lore around certain special items and bosses that you would assume are vulnerable against those weapons are and vice versa.- The game offers an extensive skill tree as well weapons and armours to choose from that offer unique set bonuses. There is also three different stances for the main weapon. Some other combat abilities tie so nicely into the lore like the shapeshifting is used to add multiple transformations to the game so that you can play as your most hated enemies.- REALLY appreciated the extensive variety of enemies. Other AAA games take note because it was a pleasure to see the variety presented in this game and also each enemy is really well detailed just *chefs kiss- The game has really nice quality of life features built in. For example if you die in a new place after a boss fight or after certain story cutscenes happen you will spawn at a temporary shrine close to an actual shrine. There is a ""gather/harvest all"" button anytime you need to collect multiple things in a menu. There is a ""retrieve lost souls"" button if you killed an enemy with an absorb-able soul and forgot to collect it. You get a HUB area where all the important npc's gather so that you can get everything at one place. The game offers multiple ways to permanently increase stats outside of skills and armour sets. THERE IS A RESET for almost all ""permanent"" upgrades that require rare materials which really alows you to experiment with builds and also kit yourself out for a specific fight.The list goes on and on and this is really such welcome additions to the game :)- The cutscenes are amazing and really cool. These cutscenes immediately reminded me of the new god of war games but with an anime type combat applied.- The game has some of the most creative and best looking bosses out there!!!- It was a really good decision to use a silent protagonist in my opinion as it gives time for the other characters to stand out. Bonus points because the destined one looks awesome!!- This is an adrenaline fueled game with awesome characters, sick looking enemies and amazing combat visuals. This was a breath of fresh air in the modern gaming scene and I would recommend the game solely on this point.But of course no product is perfect and there is most definitely issues with this game.On to the NEGATIVES:- I am going to start off with the one that angered me the most. WHY DOES A SPELL CAST CONSUME MANNA AND GO ON COOLDOWN IF YOU GET STAGGERED WHILE CASTING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I cannot describe the amount of pain this caused me. Seriously devs please fix this as it really takes away from the experience. You lose the manna immediately and also need to wait for the spell again. This would not be so bad if there were a lot of ways to regain manna but unfortunately aside from a specific gourd seed and a skill or two you just don't recover manna.- Another point regarding combat. THE GAME SIMPLY THROWS AWAY SOME INPUTS.Now what I mean by this is that sometimes you would be staggered and as you recover you want to use your flask. Now you press the heal button just a few frames to early while the staggering animation stops and the game simply ignores it meaning you are wasting time that you could have used to heal in a fight. This caused my death so many times but I will give the devs slack on this one as the alternative of an action queue would have been worse (looking at you ELDEN RING).- There is a lot of bosses in the game each with unique move sets and this is awesome!!! However this game has given me some of the WORST bosses I have ever had the displeasure to fight against in games. Some bosses have a move set so incredibly varied that I swear the developers had multiple meetings to discuss ""what can't this boss do yet"". This is not as bad though as you can learn different moves.My BIGGEST complaint on this point is that some bosses have HORRIBLE hitboxes and almost no cooldown on certain moves and combos that go on for 10+ moves like you just do not get opportunities to attack regularly. Some of the bosses that I am describing include the 100 eye daoist, the scorpion lord and most definitely the Yellow wind sage...........I believe no elaboration is needed here.- some moves, armour and weapons in my playthrough were so obsolete I never used them. For example the fire ring is a cool ability but it has to replace immobilize which is one of the best abilities in the game. Also the first stance you unlock is in my opinion the most useful stance as it allows you to move while charging focus points (however pillar stance is also really nice in some scenarios).- This game has absolutely mad difficulty spikes. Like man when I started playing this game I thought this is nothing compared to souls games , and although I would admit souls games are still harder, some of these bosses came out of nowhere and killed me over 20 times which was really random. However difficulty is not a negative. I consider this a negative as it is almost always difficult due to broken hitboxes and previously discussed points. With tuning on the hitboxes and timings of boss combos the devs will truly have some of the most amazing bosses in gaming.Overall this was an amazing experience and a game of the year contender. I will keep the conclusion short and give probably a statement that every developer wants to hear. I am completely happy with my purchase and most definitely got my enjoyment out of the product.",Recommended,5949,38.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

11799,"Black Myth: WukongLet’s make it short: This is a great game, probably the best-looking one right now while proving that Unreal Engine 5 games can also be performant and polished at release. It seems to have needed a Chinese developer to not release an AAA game before it was properly tested and finished. I can’t help but compare it to Jedi: Survivor, a game set in the biggest franchise there is and yet rushed and released in a terrible state, still performing badly today with tons of little visual glitches.The attention to detail in Wukong, the amazing art everywhere, the flawlessness of all particle effects – it’s quite the achievement. Not to mention great animations, tons of enemy types and vast, fantastic levels. Still, in the end we play games not for the eye candy, but for the fun and Wukong delivers on that level as well. Borrowing a few mechanics from Soulslikes while being a bit more action oriented and forgiving I can sum it up as being largely frustration-free. Not losing your “souls” when dying may take the edge of progressing but it also invites a more playful play style where you are encouraged to experiment. All the different options to level up, enhance gear, weapons, fighting styles, health drinks, transformations, spirits etc. etc. are introduced in a very thought-out way, never overwhelming the player – and that’s really saying something given the amount of stuff you can fiddle with. Frustration free also applies to your main and side quests, even the secret ones, where it’s mostly not possible to miss anything and be locked out of the true ending because you cannot go back. Here, you can. Mostly, because the truth is, that there are just a few things you can miss if you progress too fast: one optional boss and one large side quest spanning multiple chapters. This I found rather annoying, because it’s not in line with how the rest of the game works. Achievement hunters will also have a hard time (as in: need a lot of patience) as several achievements are dependent on random drops which I still didn’t get during my NG+ playthrough. To sum up the bad parts: you cannot fall down anywhere but on 3 or 4 locations where the game suddenly let’s you fall to your death easily, making it extra hard not to. You’re a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey but cannot climb stuff. The levels are extremely beautiful but they’re full of invisible walls making the exploration that is possible (and in some locations necessary) quite cumbersome because there is no indicator when you can walk on and when you’ll be stopped by the level’s limits. I don’t mind the restriction or the more linear approach, but a smarter level design would hide these limits much better and not let the player moonwalk again and again. It’s not world-breaking but it’s certainly an aspect which could have been improved.Back to the stuff that matters more: Western audiences (me included) may not be very familiar with “The Journey to the West”, the book Wukong is based on or at least takes lots of inspiration from. I got so intrigued while playing that I started reading the book and even though I have not finished it I can see lots of references and lovingly realized characters and locations. To have a game based on a rich, philosophical, funny fairy tale full of foreign religion, mythology and some more (please forgive this inadequate summary) provides a potent background which just resonates. It’s not like the intentionally confusing lore of the Souls games (too weird to really follow), but actual literature. Just like the bosses aren’t overdesigned monstrosities to outdo whatever came before but are recognizably based on animals and mythological creatures, looking all the better (and sometimes pleasantly fluffy) for it.And I didn’t even mention the short films between chapters – masterfully realized in different art styles - not cut scenes but actual tales; the singing character that guides you through chapter 2 or the detailed murals with great voice overs or the tons of paintings and texts on each character you can look up in the journal – plus the truly epic endings. Wukong offers lots of depth if you’re looking for it, but it never forces it on you.Finally, I have to say that the spirit of the game is one of freedom, defiance, even anarchy. There was a lot of focus on the (regrettable) misogyny that was reported, but we should also recognize that the game’s topic may very well be a statement not in line with current Chinese politics.",Recommended,3701,91.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 17

All weapons are tied to specific stances, and at higher tiers, you only have one weapon option.3.

11889,"This game is unquestionably one of the best I've ever played. It is a travesty that it only has an 81 on metacritic. I read some of the negative criticism from game reviewers and it blows my mind how much they nitpicked this game over trivial issues. For example, some reviewers complained about not having a map and getting lost. I'm half-way through the game and rarely felt lost. The areas are mostly linear by design and it did not take long to figure out where to go so I'm not sure why they're complaining. Also, the souls games had the same issue but did not get anywhere near the same level of flak for it. Another common criticism was the amount of invisible walls. Again, massively overblown. 85-90% of the time it was clear which paths were off-limits because there would be a cliff with a big drop or a body of water blocking your path. The only reasonable criticism I've seen is a few performance issues. Those do exist but it's mainly due to having a high visual effects graphic setting which makes some bosses' attacks lag the game hard. So if your computer can't handle it, just turn the setting down and you'll have no issues. Hardly a problem that should take a game from a 90 (which is what it deserves) to an 81. Finally, some reviewers complained about the lack of story. Do they not understand the kind of game this is? You're playing this game to fight awesome bosses, not read a novel.If you don't nitpick the game for every last minor thing like the above, the game is simply spectacular. Unbelievable level of enemy variety, visually stunning environments, and incredibly varied and satisfying combat that mixes magic, martial arts and transformations.

11908,"Seriously. This game shines so much in so many areas, and I love those areas.And then suddenly it just gets infuriating because of the below things....A certain boss is immune to ""Seeing Through"" so even though it looks like it works, monkey gets caught in the death animation with half his health bar gone. Very cheap and incredibly annoying. Being punished for using a mechanic that requires skill and is supposed to be fun.Activating the ""rock solid"" spell and seeing the cooldown start, but monkey does not actually perform ""rock solid"", and gets hit with massive damage. Brilliant.Button presses just not registering correctly, Such as pressing a button to cast a spell, and monkey drinks medicine instead. Seriously, what???The camera. I have no words for how bad this is in some boss fights. Being forced up against a wall or into a bush.... I have been so close to launching my controller across the room because of how utterly, ridiculously terrible this is. Why, WHY would you put an extremely challenging boss (such as Yellow Loong) on the side of a cliff with very limited space, or (the Tiger Blacksmith) in a tiny courtyard where monkey gets stuck on furniture CONSTANTLY?? Honestly, who the F made these decisions? Who thought this was a good idea? Devs, did you play test this? Did you not take on feedback? Not only do I have to think about how to beat this boss, but I have to babysit this $hit5how of a camera as well?And wait til you get to Lower Pagoda and traverse the wooden beam of death, Whilst running across it, avoid the arrows, and just as monkey is about to step off the beam onto solid ground, the camera decides to have a seizure and monkey inexplicably falls to his death. I literally did this 7 times before figuring out how to avoid this. Even when I jumped diagonally to the right to avoid the threshold where the beam meets solid ground, the game still pushed me, mid-air, off to the left side over the edge of the cliff.Once or IF the above is addressed, then I can give this a thumbs up.

The presentation, graphics, music and story to this game are all 10/10's. I was highly immersed into my play through, which really kept me invested throughout. I enjoyed the aspect of sparks and skills in this game, I felt very rewarded as I leveled, and I highly recommend diving into new game plus upon completion, as you keep your skill progress, and feel satisfaction hammering on early bosses that once gave you trouble. I don't have many knocks on this game, I feel that some invisible walls seem to make the game feel clunky, and often times in boss fights they get me stuck in a corner with no escape.

It makes me want to keep searching and wandering around.The art style is Incredible and draws you into the mythology it is based on, and the relationships of the characters makes you want to go an research their own stories.

11958,"Took me around 40 hours to finish the game, it is a very solid game, the story didn't make much sense to me as it's heavily relied on the buddhism folklore, but overall it was good and the fights were intense, the heavy stance was the one for me, the others felt useless in most fights, I didn't like the world limitation ""invisible walls"", they made the level design terrible, but other than that it's a very positive experience.",Recommended,352,38.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 16
11959,"I'll likely change my recommendation just based on any updates and I have a fairly complex opinion about this game. I just finished it. I don't think Black Myth: Wukong is a bad game, but Steam doesn't give a gray area for reviews. I can't really recommend it and I wouldn't in its current state, but at the same time I think it has a lot of positive qualities and is a good first effort from Game Science. It just has some issues, some negligible and some that are kind of annoying. I'm going to start with the negative first.To get the bad out of the way, I think the performance of the game and the level design are very frustrating. Performance will vary based on your rig, but there's a lot of optimizing that needs to be done. I played this on a fairly powerful PC, there are just weird moments where the graphics would freak out. When fighting certain bosses, the lighting wouldn't work properly and at points I'd have a grayish/blue filter over my screen until the boss fight was over.To speak to the level design, the game is linear at points and maps typically don't have much in the way of any complex vertical layering, but it also is not a game that is very clear about marking where you can and cannot go and your first playthrough will be, often in failure in my case, trying to figure out where the game will allow you to go. I would try to accomplish everything possible before moving on with a chapter and even that wouldn't go as planned. I ended up beating the Chapter 5 boss before I ever ended up finding the secret area because the game just sort of routed me to the boss in a way where I wasn't even sure I was at the final area.Good level design gives players a sense of where they are both spatially as well as narratively. I am somewhat familiar with Journey to the West enough to know some plot points and because Black Myth: Wukong takes liberties with the plot, I could never be certain if some kind of creative flourish was coming or how. So my first playthrough of the game had 3 separate files where I tried several build types. The common thread among all of them is that exploration wasn't fun. Once you learn where things are this doesn't matter, but you can say that of any game. The main thing is that it's not even fun knowing where to go in many instances. It truly leaves much to be desired, especially for a game taking after games by From Software. Lies of P was a much better sophomore effort in terms of emulating From Soft map design, however crudely.Those two elements are somewhat deal breakers to me in terms of recommending the game, but I don't think they are things that cannot be addressed or fixed.As far as combat goes, this is truly a mixed bag. I love Black Myth: Wukong when it isn't trying to be a souls game with highly regimented, overly defensive gameplay. There are times where Black Myth: Wukong becomes terrified at the idea that it has options like parrying, armor points, and other things that would make fights feel much more interactive. Many enemies in the game will actively suckerpunch you, scurry out of the way or outright float backwards if you try to so much as engage them. The fundamental concept that gels Black Myth: Wukong's fighting system together is ""dodge out of way in a memorized sequence."" It does this for its entire duration. This is a case where it's not whether something doesn't work or is broken, this is a case in my review where I'm going to say that this style of combat is like stretching a single idea across the entire duration of a game and it just feels boring.I think for a lot of players; however, action games are a bit of a novelty. So I think this isn't necessarily the same level of problem as having crappy map design and game performance. Black Myth: Wukong is a relatively simple game where I often died trying to find some way to win a fight OTHER than by ""move out of way real good."" And there are options where the game will spice up the combat, but it will just as often negate your combat options into a sterile paste of ""move out of way then take the turn."" Call and response. This is amateur hour fight design, it's not good no matter how much superfluous crap you put in if you're too afraid to allow the player to do something focal other than ""dodge.""The reason I point this out is that, on the same side, there were things Wukong did as a game with combat and action that I loved. A partner character that isn't completely useless, awesome scripted fights, and one fight in particular that reminded me of an old X-Box 360 Capcom game in the best way possible. It is a mixed bag, but as much as I think Wukong's combat is boring and one dimensional for no reason, Game Science could often show a lot of restraint. I found myself really liking the game when it wasn't trying to be a less good version of a Souls game. I want to see more of that from the team, but I feel like making a Souls game gives a lot of room to be lazy because if something is bad you just chalk it up to ""being a Souls game.""I don't know what the future holds for Game Science, but this was a genuinely solid first effort. It just managed to really get on my nerves. I'm going to keep my eye on patches that might address some quality of life stuff for map and level navigation, because the map design is a dealbreaker. It's extremely bad to use invisible walls instead of coherent design, no matter how many real world areas you scan. That's just too much of a burden on a player.Performance, that may never change either. But I think if you can look past that, my opinion about action game combat notwithstanding, there is so much to love about Black Myth: Wukong. I love the production value and I love that it's not trying to steal my money and mentally addle me in the process. I have some hopes for this studio. I don't recommend it, but it's also not a bad game. There are bad qualities to it, but overall I hope that Game Science continues supporting the game. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled in the event I can change this review to positive. But I think success is better than any harsh words I can deliver.",Not Recommended,4968,113.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

11995,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of a groundbreaking achievement in gaming, blending breathtaking visuals, engaging gameplay, and an immersive world inspired by ancient Chinese mythology. As a player, you step into the shoes of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, embarking on an epic journey filled with challenges, mythical beasts, and awe-inspiring environments.Graphics and Art Style:One of the most striking features of Black Myth: Wukong is its jaw-dropping graphics. From the very first moments, the world feels alive, filled with meticulously detailed environments, creatures, and atmospheric lighting. The Unreal Engine 5 truly shines here, creating lifelike textures and animations that push the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming. Whether you're exploring misty bamboo forests or battling legendary foes in sun-drenched landscapes, the visuals leave a lasting impression.Gameplay and Combat:The combat in Black Myth: Wukong is fluid and satisfying, with a deep focus on timing, strategy, and mastering Sun Wukong's various abilities. Players can shapeshift into different forms, each with its own set of moves and advantages. This adds an exciting layer of depth to combat, making every encounter feel fresh and dynamic. Boss fights are especially memorable, with towering creatures that test your skills and creativity.While the game offers intense battles, it’s also wonderfully balanced with moments of exploration, puzzle-solving, and character development. The pacing feels perfect, allowing players to enjoy both the combat and the rich narrative that unfolds.Story and Mythology:Drawing heavily from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the story is rich in lore and mythology. The game expertly weaves the legend of the Monkey King into an engaging narrative filled with twists, humor, and drama. Each character and enemy you meet has a deep connection to Chinese folklore, giving the world an authentic, mythological feel.Sound Design and Music:The sound design is another highlight, with beautifully composed music that enhances every moment of the game. The soundtrack shifts seamlessly between epic orchestral pieces during battles and more serene, traditional tunes when exploring peaceful areas. Voice acting, whether in English or Mandarin, is also top-notch, adding emotional depth to key moments.Performance and Technical Aspects:Even with its stunning graphics, Black Myth: Wukong runs remarkably well on modern systems. Load times are minimal, and the game maintains a smooth framerate even during its most intense moments. The developers have clearly taken care to optimize the game, ensuring players can enjoy its beauty without technical hiccups.Final Verdict:Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play for any action RPG fan or anyone with an appreciation for mythology and epic storytelling. Its stunning visuals, engaging combat, and rich narrative make it one of the most memorable gaming experiences of recent years. With so much attention to detail and a perfect blend of gameplay and story, it’s easy to recommend this game 100%. Black Myth: Wukong sets a new standard for the genre, and it’s a journey worth taking.Recommendation: 100%",Recommended,2721,17.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

Out of all the FromSoft games, I would say that feel of combat is closest to Sekiro, and while it doesn't quite reach the level of polish that Fromsoft produces, its an admirable first attempt. This is not a spectacle fighter or a combo based fighter - so if you prefer DMCV like combat then this won't suit.Visually looks amazing on an RTX 4080. In particular, water caustics, particle effects and physically based deformation of sand and snow look truly next gen.Areas for improvement: Level design is not as refined as Fromsoft titles, and visual design within each chapter could be more varied.

The game is so linear that i spent more time running around back and forth just to still come up empty handed. Missed out on multiple bosses in the volcano area because the area was significantly shorter then the rest and once you kill the main boss, all of the side/secret content just evaporate apparently.",Recommended,448,61.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

12068,"You've already seen other reviews so you know other people think this is GOTY. I agree. 2 things: for one, if you have never played a souls like/ souls lite (idk which one Wukong is cuz people keep arguing abt it), and you get this game expecting it to be a walk in the park, don't get it. I've seen a bunch of reviews of people complaining about delayed inputs when dodging or healing, but that's not the problem. If you're having trouble like that, either you have a hardware issue, or a skill issue. Secondly, I have to disagree with the reviews that say it's poor level design. It's not. You just like your open world games. Me and many other people think the level design is great, and you can say thats an opinion, but then you just have poor taste.

The landscapes are breathtaking, the graphics are amazing. The highlight of this game are the bosses. They are very unique and have good design. Some bosses could also lead to frustration if you do not make a specific build for them. The game is hard, but the reward of beaten a boss is excellent. You feel satisfied. The story is good, the journal gives the player a good description of all yaoguais. Game Science really paid attention to the artistic aspect. Very well done animations. Soundtrack is marvelous, the music was very well executed on bosses sections and, of course, animations. People complaining about invisible walls in the game is very ridiculous. Better to have invisible walls and have something to do at every corner than make a open world with nothing in it. Nevertheless, I missed a map and a quest screen that point where to go to do the side quests. This made the score go to 8. Therefore, Black Myth: Wukong has the potential do be GOTY.

12153,"YOU ARE THE DESTINED ONE!Black Myth lives up to all the hype it promised. I currently have 60+ hours logged on this game at the time of writing and will easily log another 120 in the coming weeks. The game play reminds me of Dark Souls / Bloodborne in its construction. The world is pre-established before we get into it, The Journey to the West has been over with for quite some time and The Destined One lives up to his namesake.In terms of story, knowing Chinese mythology prior to playing certainly helps. Most new players will get a fun and engaging experience but will find themselves lost if they don't know anything about Sun Wukong prior to now. Some of the dialogue will feel like it's disjointed and make what's happening unclear. That said, it feels Shakespearean in scope and flow, making it feel more like a grand epic than a serialized story.I noticed my graphical experience dropping at certain points in the game. I don't think my CPU is powerful enough for my GPU to render and run the game the way it needs to without lagging when cut scenes start or when it needs to render a boss fight on a large scale. I don't blame the game, what that tells me is that Game Science kept their promise and delivered a game that was going to be massive in scope and scale, and if you're able to, render it in such a high quality that it makes the jaw drop.At the end of the day, I plan to play Black Myth: Wukong over and over again.

12158,"Looks good but I have issues with the combat. The light attacks are not satisfying at all (5th hit is alright) and boss fights take hundreds of light attacks to kill so it adds up. Transforming into the dog guy also abruptly switches the music so if you transform toward the end of the boss fight, when the music is building up with the banjo and all that, you're left with a underwhelming soundtrack to finish off the boss. There are also issues with elevation and invisible boundary walls which interferes with killing mobs, running around, and the overall immersion. The bosses themselves are very well made so they become fun to vs despite doing very little damage to them and the boss music is hype. I also like how there are tons of bosses and not many mobs so I don't have to waste time killing tons of small fry (most of the time) to reach a boss. Spells are cool and the upgrades have little impact but there is a lot of customization which is nice. Overall I would give it a 7/10, not a must buy but if you like the combat style and/or wukong lore you could buy it.",Recommended,873,10.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

Also, let's take a moment to appreciate that the game's full price is $60 instead of the $70 that large companies are now asking us to fork over. All in all, great game with a very deep story/lore.Needless to say, I'll be waiting for the DLC to drop on this and will be purchasing it Day 1.",Recommended,377,66.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 16
12199,"Based on my experience playing this game for the first time, I did not encounter a single bug or glitch, which is impressive for first-time players. I played on my laptop with the graphics settings maxed out, and the game ran smoothly. I also used a PS4 controller, which worked seamlessly. This game is a must-play, and I highly recommend it. I own the deluxe edition, but I would say it's not worth the extra cost. The deluxe edition includes music and in-game items, but those items are primarily useful only for Chapter 1. From Chapter 2 onwards, you will need to craft items to progress and defeat bosses. Enjoy",Recommended,507,14.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

12240,"From the moment Black Myth: Wukong was first announced, anticipation for the game reached fever pitch, and it is with great excitement that I can confirm the game has not only met but exceeded every expectation. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece and redefines the action RPG genre with its innovative mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and deep narrative.Graphics and Art Design: 10/10The visual experience of Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of revolutionary. The game features some of the most stunning graphics seen in the genre to date. The environments are lush and incredibly detailed, from the dense, mysterious forests to the imposing, ancient ruins. The character models are equally impressive, with meticulous attention given to Wukong’s fluid movements and the intricate designs of the mythical creatures. The art direction, inspired by classic Chinese mythology, merges seamlessly with cutting-edge technology, creating a world that is both fantastical and immersive.Gameplay and Mechanics: 10/10The gameplay in Black Myth: Wukong is a triumph of innovation and polish. The combat system is dynamic and fluid, offering a rich array of options and techniques that cater to various playstyles. Wukong’s ability to shapeshift and harness mystical powers adds layers of strategy to each encounter. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenging combat and rewarding progression. The enemy AI is sophisticated, requiring players to think critically and adapt their tactics. Additionally, the game's diverse range of environments ensures that combat remains engaging throughout the experience.Story and World-Building: 10/10Black Myth: Wukong excels in storytelling and world-building. Drawing inspiration from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the game crafts a narrative that is both rich in lore and emotionally engaging. The story of Wukong is presented with a depth and nuance that elevates it beyond traditional action RPG narratives. The world is expansive and filled with intriguing lore, offering players a deep dive into a mythological universe that feels alive and constantly evolving.Sound and Music: 10/10The auditory experience in Black Myth: Wukong is masterful. The soundtrack, composed by a talented team, perfectly complements the epic scale of the game. From hauntingly beautiful melodies to powerful orchestral arrangements, the music enhances the emotional impact of the narrative and the intensity of combat. Sound effects are equally well-crafted, with each strike, spell, and environmental noise contributing to the immersive experience.Overall Experience: 10/10Black Myth: Wukong is a landmark achievement in the action RPG genre. It brings together exceptional visuals, innovative gameplay, a captivating story, and an outstanding soundscape to create a truly unforgettable experience. It’s a game that sets a new standard for what is possible in the genre and is a must-play for any fan of action RPGs or epic storytelling.

12293,"I'm half way through the second chapter and it's been a solid experience so far. The visuals are stunning and combat is (mostly) fluid.My favorite mechanic is perfect dodging. In general, I hate it when games just give you invincibility frames during a dodge and allow you to casually roll right through an attack that intersects your hitbox. It completely breaks the immersion for me. However, Wukong gets away with doing this with the perfect dodge mechanic, and it is extremely satisfying.Allow me to explain. When you execute a perfect dodge, time slows down and your character is replaced with a ghostly after-image that takes the hit for oyu. You have invincibility frames, but it is internally consistent and not immersion breaking. This is because the implication is that your character is moving so fast that the enemy is swinging at after-images. It's an ingenious mechanic that I hope more fighting games incorporate.In terms of gameplay, a lot of people have compared it to Dark Souls due to the difficult boss battles. However, the series reminds me most of is the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm franchise. It's like if someone took that, removed Naruto from it, improved it in every way, and gave it AAA polish.My only substantial complaint is that the bosses seem a bit cheesy at times. This is why I said mostly fluid. You need to have precise timing to execute the perfect dodges, which means you essentially need to memorize your enemies attack patterns. So when you first encounter a boss, you are almost guaranteed to die several times because you have no idea what their attack animations look like. A lot of the boss attacks are not fluid. They have an obvious ""windup"" phase. For example, they might raise their arm up to strike you and just freeze there for a second. I get the feeling that the devs did this to make it easier. It gives you time to recognize that an attack is incoming. But most of the time it just makes it harder. By the time the boss unfreezes, it's usually too late to dodge. But if you dodge too early, your timing will be off and you will get hit. So you're kind of just stuck in limbo during the windup and you just have to the timing. In addition to making it harder, it ruins the fluidity of the combat. It is probably too late to fix this in a patch, but I hope they consider changing it for a sequel or DLC.",Recommended,1934,20.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

There is no BS in the game, just play monkey and fight tons of great bosses and explore very well put together levels. The gameplay itself is outstanding, smooth and polished is an understatement. The environment and music is breath taking not to mention all the cinematics between chapters are insanely good, especially the true ending one.

12383,"This is a spoiler-free review. I genuinely enjoyed this game and the amount of twists and turns it has for me.On August 24th, joining the first 10 million players.I purchased my first AAA game which was released in the first weekNever ever playing a souls-like game. I was expecting to refund the game if I spent the first 2 hours dying.2 hours later. The rush of killing the first 3 bosses ignited a fire within me.55 hours later, Beating over 100 bosses, I finished the game's story.And it was the best 55 hours of my life, and I'm sure as hell going to replay the game after I finish this review.The gameplay:Its a souls-like game (yeah duh).But its forgiving compared to what I have seen from Elden Ring and Dark Souls.This game has a levelling system which you could grind mobs to level up if a boss was too hard.Upon each level, you gain perks that can make bosses easier to beat.Longer invincibility, new stances and upgrades, healing capacity and perks, transformation buffs, spellsAnd the best part? You aren't tied to those perks! You can freely reassign perks as you wish.This allows you to play around with the perks to figure out which style you like the most.The crafting:While progressing, you can craft new armour and weapons using loot from bosses and mobs.Herbs aplenty for you to gather. Crafting potions which'll aid you against bosses.Pickup those herb seeds, you can a place that can grow them.The world:I spent at least 3 hours just staring at scenery. Meditation points throughout the world which allows you to relax before/after a heart-pumping boss fightEach area is extremely unique. Some with transformations and transport tools available for you to move around the world.Massive creatures looming in the distance. Cut scenes looking straight out of a Chinese Folk Drama.And the music... Oh the music...Listening to the plucks of traditional instruments while you gaze at mountains.Orchestral roars and grandiose vocals fill your ears as you duel with bossesWith side quests in the corners if you know where to lookBut this game isn't without imperfections.There are moments in the game where the path forward is hard to spot.In a certain cave section. It took me a while before I realised there were drop-downs out of sight that were the way forward.And when there was a mandatory minigame where I kept losing stamina, I didn't know it was a stats requirement... It would've really helped if my companion could suggest what exactly I needed to do when I lost that mini game.Bosses would had weaknesses that can only be exploited with a spell you can get in the same chapter. This personally got on my nerves but its probably just because I never really played souls-like games to know this stuff..But in the end, Its a magnificent game.A great exposure into the story of the Journey to the West. A staple of storytelling in Chinese Folklore.The devs did a great job proving that Early Access has no place in a $60 game.You buy a complete product. Singleplayer from start to finish.Game Science. It must've been a rocky road getting this game out.You have my utmost respect and gratitude for this masterpiece of a game in the 21st century.Best game I've ever played. 9/10. I'm docking 1 because of whoever designed the final boss...He is the cheekiest bastard in China... -_-",Recommended,2742,118.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

12459,"After finally beating the game, I've earned the right to give a ""review""Consider this a counter balance to the - frankly - baffling reception this game has gotten.It's not bad at all, but I would summarise it as TEDIOUS.It is ironically the most souls-like you could possibly imagine. What else would it be? A character action game with three stances, one combo each? Pardon me as I lol! It is a game about, through trial and error, learning which button to press when, until you eventually win.There are two types of encounters:- Super easy, mash them to death. This includes many bosses.- Very hard. Either by spamming many enemies at you, or bosses that have so many gimmicks you need to have notepad open on the side.- AOEs and other attacks without any visible wind-up? Yes sir- Enemies that heal? Absolutely- Enemies that turn themselves untouchable and (irritatingly) just stand there? Oh yeah- Enemies that disappear from the camera only to come in and hit you from nowhere? My personal favourite!The game is very pretty, but the areas are sort of linear but in an open environment. Everything looks a bit same-y, which makes exploring... you guessed it, tediousHardly any weapon or build variety. You will be doing pretty much the same things throughout the game.It's an ok game, play it if you like!

12488,"A JTTW story I've been wanting for. Except being made as a game was not in my bucket list!One day I revisited JTTW, and turns out learning it as an adult opens up different perspectives about the whole situation. The bureaucracy and judgement were kinda messed up, although the differences between good and bad are often grey. This game expands the story with its own perspective, yet still faithful to the original source. It fills some of the holes for me, especially with its true ending.The art—especially the characters—feels surreal and epic. The surreal aspect is what brings a divine impression for me.I had a lot of fun exploring the game. It feels like there are always more. When I thought I've definitely explored the whole things, turns out there were still a lot more things I missed. Boss battles were fun. I find it satisfying figuring out different play styles for different bosses.Lastly, I'm actually surprised that I beat this game despite playing in a low spec device. The overall performance was great, frame rate was smooth. The small problem I had is that since I installed it in HDD, the initial world loading time was around 15 minutes (probably at least 1/3 of my playtime is loading time lol), and there are occasional noticeable lags (in my case could take even more than 10 sec each) from lazy loads happening in the middle of the game, and getting even worse in cutscenes, resulting in unsynchronized audio. I've checked some of streamers playing in high & mid quality also experiences the occasional lags and having audio not in sync as well, although by far not as bad as mine. The audio not in sync is especially quite a big immersion problem.

12505,"One of the best adventure games everDevelopers had an advantage of taking a very well developed world and one of the most famous story in it. And they not only took it but they delivered on it. Game has wide variety of enemies each of them has it's own backstory (obviously taken from chinese folklore but still) which slightly enlarge our understanding of the world. And just this world and story is enough to give this game a try even if you are not a fan of any other aspects of the game.Game consists of 6 chapters each of which has it's unique enemy cast (with exception of ch5) and corresponding bosses. I remember entering ch5 and my thought ""lol those enemies are just reskins of earlier ones lazy devs"". But in any other game I would just perceive this as a norm and the fact that I perceived this as a minus speaks very highly about enemy variety in the game.Bosses divides in two parts - chiefs and kings. Difficulty-wise they are mixed up, kings just have more shiny moves I guess...Bosses in a vacuum are all awesome - they has their place in the world, they has a backstory, they have cool moves and good loot. Also they are balanced pretty good for an adventure game even tho I wish they was harder cos amount of bosses I just first try facetanked is unhealthy in my opinion. On the other hand I heard that some people struggles a lot on different bosses so my opinion is not objective here. And yes, I also struggled on those two bosses :)Maps are also awesome - with unique biomes and gorgeous views. They are normal adventure type maps with branching path to the end boss. But game doesn't have any map in menu so navigating and finding all secrets can be quite time consuming (especially in ch3).Chapter 6 map is failed (in my opinion) experiment on openworld type of map. There is literally nothing in it except for a few bad bosses and 1 (one!) chest.Why ch6 bosses are bad? I hate 2 types of bosses: ""puzzle"" boss and ""catch me ♥♥♥♥♥"" boss. They are like 90% of ch6 bosses :(But game is not without technical problems of courseFirst of all - camera. Camera can get behind a tree or a wall which is annoying. Also camera tracking is quite loose so if you move around around the boss too much or if boss is has very mobile moveset - he will be out of your field view for a good 30+% of a fight. Also you can just lose target lock during some of boss moves if you don't manually readjust camera during fight (which is annoying if you use gamepad).Minor problem with inputs - for example run button won't register if you pressed it before your run-prohibiting move ends.And annoying problem with lack of target tracking. Like you know how lazy boss designers adds insane target tracking to all moves of bosses - here designers went deeper - heavy attack after roll in 75% of cases will just miss the mark completely - it's not hitting where enemy was, nor where he is going, just some random particle in the air, which is extremely frustrating after you spent like a minute to charge this attack.But despite these problems game is still awesome, bosses are still very manageable due to variety of builds (and ability to redo your build at any time).Solid",Recommended,2591,47.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

When fighting huge bosses, the camera sometimes just goes underneath you and the boss, which makes it a tad difficult and a bit annoying.

Fight you're way through with new acquired abilities, plenty of time to practice with your new found power. I found that many of the bosses had the same attack animation or patterns overtime. But when you find a difficult challenge, you'll have to wake up from repeating cycle.Hit boxes are quite inconsistent or you can't make connection. Not only that, invisible walls or objects all around the game. A few boss fights had me memorising where invisible objects would stop me from dodging or cornering.Story, you'll have to know about the Journey to the west before hand.

It is really unclear. I think because all the environment is kind of similar. Trees, stones etc and as an example while explore the location you will encounter an enemy, fight it and loose track of where you are. Many times I was just walking in circles not realising I have already seen this place before. It is all the same!Combat, lore, graphics, music, beautiful paintings and murals. general mood and feeling of adventure make it all worth it.All the more, grinding through the arduous navigation make it worth it in the endgame.

12570,"This game is highly overrated, but its decent.This is game is pretty much a boss rush, you won't walk 5 minutes without fighting either a boss or mini boss and the combat is very decent.This is NOT a souls-like... The only souls-like feature this game has is the terrible camera angles in some fights (some of which are worse than the worst camera of all souls games)Also, the storytelling is AWFUL. This is an epilogue to journey to the west, but every chapter makes 0 sense, dialogue is weird and you need to be either Chinese of have plenty of knowledge of the story to have a grasp. It's not even ""hey, story told in items"", nah, the story is just poorly told.There are also some bugs that may cause bosses to stop attacking you for no reason.

I was not expecting the combat to be this intuitive and fluid; the bosses in this game are fun and fair.The only negative thing I can say about the game is that they don't explain very well the mechanics but that's pretty intuitive to understand.All in all I hope more game developers and publishers take note of the success this game has had and will at least try to move in this direction.,Recommended,412,22.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

(Etc Chapter 2, 4, and 5 secret bosses, chapter 3 dragon that shows in trailer, and chapter 4 final boss) Above mentioned boss hit box is .. um weird.. hope the dev fix these.Another thing, the whole story in this game is like the continuous of the journey to the west novel, so highly recom to do some research in the particular chapter before start the chapter, otherwise u wont understand anything.Overall highly recom to give it a try, i wont say its def a goty but its good game.

To have those would do a disservice to the game as it is straightforward enough.Boss fights and art design clears many, many games, you will not be bored that's for sure.",Recommended,569,107.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

12652,"Pros:- gorgeous world- great portrayal of chinese mythology- the 2d cutscenes are amazing- fun player combat mechanics- great skill tree & gear upgradesCons:- almost every single cutscene lags to the point where the audio is unsynced- i could make a cup of coffee and play with my dog during loading screens and it's still not done- level design is lacking. boundaries are unclear and inconsistent with tons of invisible colliders used- lots of confusing and unnecessary branching paths that encourages missed content- some bosses are easy whereas some are really unfair. who decided it'd be a good idea to reduce the player's hp during a cutscene? you should never penalize a player for something that is not within their control. also, expect to have big differences in the animation you see vs the exact time you should dodge. in some cases, it's also definite that you'll get hit.overall, i had fun at the earlier chapters but the boss fights in the later chapters has caused a burn out. is it GOTY quality? i'd say not at all. do not expect elden ring from this game because it is far from it but still worth trying if you're into chinese mythology.",Not Recommended,955,36.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The game provides you with tools and limitless possibilities to change your build and style at choice without much commitment to a build. That allows for experimentation in an overall challenging game and keeps it fun and refreshing at every encounter. If you're having problems with a specific place or boss, you can rest at the shrine and allocate your sparks (points) into different skills and stats and that changes your approach for the encounter considerably.Character design is top-notch. Each boss fight is very different.At the simplest: It is a pure fun-game, and we don't have many FUN games anymore at this price point, and that's something very important.Thank you, Game Science.",Recommended,633,36.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

It's a boss rush with large, beautiful, largely empty levels. There are occasional trash mobs but they literally fall over if you sneeze in their direction. If you're unfamiliar with Journey to the West the ""story"" here is going to be incomprehensible and it's coming by way of a self consciously wordy localisation.

12708,"Honestly an incredible game. It delivered on exactly what they advertised with it. You can tell at all points there was a great deal of care put into lore and the dialogue feeds into this as well. It's absolutely a love letter to the Journey to the West mythos and it hits home hard with that.As someone who's played through all of FromSoft's soulsborne titles, it's less of that and a bit more of a usual action game, but it takes a great deal of inspiration in structure and feel from those. It's definitely a bit easier than those, though still a fair challenge all around with a great deal of fights.The art is fantastic all around. Looking too close, you will definitely see how a lot of the environment was arranged from asset pack meshes, but they are arranged wonderfully in most areas. They did indeed do an incredible job with the vistas. The character models are all beautiful and animated cleanly. There's an abundance of variety here with crazy effects to boot. If you don't stare too close outside the normal play area, there's a great deal of eye candy to enjoy.Music and sounds are on point throughout. There's quite a bit of unique music all around and it paints the world with variety. Ambient sounds match well with the environments and boost those as you'd hope while the active sound effects sound snappy and fitting for the gameplay. The sounds guys did their homework.Cinematics go hard whether we're talking about the ingame cutscenes or the meticulously animated shorts between chapters. Again, as with the lore they really made sure these worked.Now, it's not perfect. The game probably could be more optimized, and in particular, maybe because of Denuvo or something, there are occasional stutters that are pretty bad, though these seem to even out as the game goes or when an asset like a spirit has to load. Unfortunately the stutters can cause desyncs in cutscenes on occasion, which is sad since otherwise those do work amazingly. Loading was also fairly lengthy for a game in this era. Lastly, 100%ing the game requires some grindy farming which wasn't likely to come naturally through only subsequent playthroughs.Still, you can tell there was an incredible amount of love put into this and I can easily say the game as a package is worthwhile. The gameplay is well put together and while I feel like going for every possible achievement isn't the best experience, I would 100% recommend doing everything involved in getting the secret ending. There's loads of great bosses to find that you'll only see going for all that.",Recommended,2115,89.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

12750,"Overall a great game, addictive and fun game play, souls-like beginner friendly (once you figure out timing) and beautiful graphics, with steady performance.After the day-one driver hiccups and figuring out how to best run the game, I have had 0 issues. There are some negative reviews, some over exaggerated ones as well, but overall it is a GREAT game. I personally am not a fan of souls-like games, i don't have the skills (and patients) for it, but this has been a blast.The pacing if great, there is a boss around every other corner that delivers a fun challenge, and the journey is a beautiful and pleasant experience.I play it on in wither 1440p (at my desk) or 4K from (from the couch) with almost everything set to CINEMATIC (minus Ray Tracing which I honestly don't think makes much of a difference in this game) set at a 60fps locked. with FSR enabled.

Yes, it's just a touch older, but it is still a powerful PC, but I can barely squeak out 90 FPS on High, having to use the awful implemented frame generation, which makes it look worse than ""low"", all while my computer sounds like it's trying to work as a heater. What did they test this on? A 4090? There is no point in making the game absolutely beautiful if above average PCs that run it will become a space heater, or have a 1,600 workhorse graphics card. I've tried optimizing the game, but random settings are CPU/Graphics extensive for no reason. Why does lowering cloud textures outside of the first intro cannibalize almost 15 FPS? That means that the developers have it rendering in the background constantly. Horrible optimization ruins an otherwise beautiful game, and I have no interest in upgrading my PC to play just one game.

Exploration also plays a significant role, with a mix of platforming, puzzles, and combat enriching the gameplay experience.The narrative focuses on Sun Wukong’s legendary journey, intertwining traditional lore with new content to appeal to both fans of the original story and newcomers. While the game is still in development, early trailers and demos have showcased its potential, suggesting it could become a standout title in the action RPG genre.

12784,"Performs incredibly poorly, even on the lowest possible settings I am barely able to make it through cutscenes, to the point where it starts to become glitchy, and this carries into boss fights that involve background effects. Normally I can accept low frame rates and simply tolerate them, but in a souls like game with dodge rolling mechanics it essentially artificially throttles my reaction time. I am also experiencing problems such as abilities occasionally failing to work and the character appearing to be locked onto an axis of movement even though I am not locked on to my target.I am genuinely enjoying this game, which is why it is so frustrating that I'm having these problems which are getting in the way of my ability to properly play it, if you haven't bought this game yet I would suggest looking at your performance before hitting the two hour mark and possibly refunding the game before you continue, because at sixty dollars I genuinely believe I might have wasted my moneyEDIT: After reaching chapter 2 I can say with confidence that I wasted sixty dollars, I can't refund it because I've played it for too long, but the problems didn't seriously make me consider refunding until I'd gone well beyond the two hour mark, fighting bosses at a consistent 29 FPS in a fast paced souls like simply isn't worth it.

The controls are not PC friendly without a lot tinkering and I never got used to the ability lag or the strange way the bosses behave and when I did finally kill some it was on to another frustration-pump of a boss with no real reward.

12869,"8/10 for action RPG veteran1/10 for casual playerHere are the reason why I rated it like this:1) This game is on the harder end of the general gaming spectrum. It is not meant for casual player. There is only 1 difficulty. There is no “play for the story” mode.2) The game design is extremely lacking in information. There is no map, no quest tracking, no info on combination. Translation of skills and information is bad or outright wrong. All the information I learn are from 3rd party website. Things like, what does resolution strike actually do, what is the counter input, how much dmg does focus attack worth, where to get what items, what skills scale, what doesn’t, etc. Is like the developer purposely refuse to give even general information to the player. Like how long does a immobilize skill last? They wont say. You have to find out from 3rd party, who then experiment and put it on a spread sheet. Purposely withholding information, is not a skill. I find all the information online anyway, whats the point of having bad description, no numbers on spell time , no map, no quest tracking????3) The boss fights are hard. Yes I know, players who are used to dark soul, will probably gate keep and say its easy, everyone can do it. But the game is hard for the casual player base who have never play dark soul before. I will use Witcher 3 death march as a comparison. This game is probably 50 times harder. Why? Because the attack timing vs doge timing is extremely tight. We are talking about a fraction of a second. And the boss will have 3-6 attacks per attack pattern. And about 4-8 attack patterns per boss. Boss are usually big, dash, aoe, and a mix of instant teleport or delay attacks. Which mean, if you are casual player, you will use the first 5-10 deaths just learning the attacks and when is safe to doge. Than you have to die another 5-10 times, to learn when its safe to attack. Because your attacks will not stun anyone, unless it has focus points. And boss regular light attack will stun you, and at times chain stun you. So if you eat the first attack, you might eat the whole thing. 3-6 attacks can probably kill you, unless you are over level. And yea, you know those official review that said this game is a button mashing?? You cant do that. If you just mash input like doge, you will get hit, because the boss will track where you land if you don’t time it right. In fact, any player who haven’t learn those doge mechanics will have a hard time getting out of charpter 2. Don’t believe me, just google youtube fights with charpter 1 boss like the wandering weight, or the white clan noble. And of course, tiger vanguard, that cat that has probably break many controllers.4) The story is amazing, but there is not enough cut scene to show it. If you read the massive paragraph for each character, you will find most boss have a sad and worth tell story. If you don’t read it, (I cant bother reading all of them) they are just another boss to kill. (Most of them are annoying and required 5-50 deaths to memorise their attack pattern)I hope those reading understand why I give 2 different rating. I do regret buying this game to a certain extend. But I don’t want politics to win, so I gladly keep this and slowly finishing this game. But I wont be buying its next instalment. I don’t have the time to play such a high skill cap game. If I didn’t know there is not difficulty setting, I probably wont spend time on this.Ps: I want to add one more point, this game doesn’t feel like I am building a RPG. Because a lot of the items are locked behind a certain boss clear. You can increase your level, but you cant “craft” an advance item until you clear a certain area. Weapons and amor are hard locked by area. If only this game have a lower difficulty setting...=======================================================================Update 27/oct/2024I rarely review games, nor do I update review. But I have since complete ng+, a little bit of NG2+,and a new start on chap 1 to give some perspective. I have also used the tanking building for NG+ as well. So here goes:1. Invisible walls make this game very sad as it confused players where to go2. There are inconsistent in game rule in terms where a player can fall and die. Like 1% of the whole game.3. Boss fights, are mixed of easy to frustratingly hard. Its due to my review’s reasons. The hard bosses all have a certain characteristics; Large, bad hit boxes, aggressive and attack 80% of a time, you missed one doge and you might die taking 3-5 hits in a row with no recovery, Jumping or flying all over the place, which reduce time to hit the boss, stupid delay and fast attack mixed up, very large hp, + commend grab that does a lot of damage. Everyone have different opinions who are the top bosses to fight. But I think for the top 30%, the bosses all have the above characteristic.4. Story telling isn’t that amazing. Its there, but they could easily triple the cut sene to tell the story. Like charpter 2, they could have show what happen to the city and why the people become who they are. Instead, all you get is words.5. Music is very good 10/106. So is graphic, 10/107. RPG in terms of building a character that you want? 3/10. Especially for first play through, my god … Items are hard locked behind boss clear. The starting staff you will use for the whole 1st ch. You cant even upgrade damage till the game lets you build the next staff.8. In game description still absolutely suck 3 month after release. No numbers, everything you need, you will find on website. Not in game. Things like rock solid timing, damage with 4 focus point, defence rating calculation. Like its 2024, which is developer expecting gamers to work out these number on 3rd party website??? Are we in 1994, where the developer is selling a separate guild???Conclusion. Look guys. This game is so damn polarizing. Like.. on your first play thru on chapter one, you will die a lot. When I play it againt from the 2nd time, I still die like 10-20 times. That’s with all the knowledge I know. I cant switch stances, cause not enough level. I cant use cloud steps till after kill black bear once. I definitely have no access to damage reduction gear or the full bull king set. So I have to doge everything . I don’t have rock solid, and no thrust stance till level 20. So, charpter 1 fresh start, at least for the bosses is actually harder than NG6+ with good gear. Like I can do 80% reduction+ 700 defense, + full bull king set, and I wont be stagger and can kill bosses in Ng +++++. I might not be perfect but I have luxury to make mistakes. First play thru, I don’t have any of that Luxury.So…how should I sum up this game? Should I say its soul like? Maybe its easy after NG+? Goty? Well, given how inperfect this game is, and that there are no difficulty setting, no I don’t think this is GOTY. Developer wants players to master doging, and than mixed in heavy attacks and special attacks, and spirits, and spells. Which is why on youtube, you can see those pros with no hit runs. Which is cool from their perspective. But what about the entire gaming community and the gaming consumers??? Are we all expected to have those perfect run to beat bosses? For the 1st chapter of your first play thru…pretty close that’s what you need. And the word I have heard that IMO best describes this game is that it is a “Dodging simulator”.So…is this game worth buying? I don’t think I can answer that. Because if you are good with these type of games. Sure. If you are 50 years old, and you want to come home after work and just chill for like an hour. Then I would say no. I think…thats a fair comment to make. If only there are lower difficulty, I would rate this a good 7/10 for everyone. But if time is important, then really why should someone spend their good time to memorize a boss attack pattern???? I am glad I beat this game.I hope this summery help for those reading this.",Not Recommended,6488,138.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Though you can grind for resources, the game’s difficulty strikes a perfect balance. Some boss fights will push you to your limits, making you sweat, but it’s still more forgiving than Soulsborne games—there’s no resource loss upon death, which is a welcome relief. However, it is definitely harder than God of War.The boss battles are plentiful, each one distinct and memorable, set against some truly captivating environments that are a visual treat.

12909,"Strengths.Black Myth: Wukong makes an immediate impact with its impressive visual presentation and fluid animations. From the first moments, the game showcases what modern technology can achieve in terms of graphics and design even with not top class hardware. The fluidity of movement, especially in combat, is striking, with character animations flowing seamlessly, creating a visually satisfying experience.The protagonist is a refreshing take on the traditional hero. He's a monkey. A trickster character who uses tricks like shadow clones and going invisible. Although towards the end of the game, he reincarnates into a more pompous version of himself. He draws from classic, Journey to the West, but comes across as more grounded. Unlike many games where the hero is immensely powerful from the start. This makes the gameplay feel more dynamic, as you engage in battles that aren’t always won by brute force.One of the standout features of the game is its flexibility in character development. You are encouraged to experiment with different builds, as respeccing comes with no penalties. This system fosters creativity and exploration, allowing you to adapt to different situations without fear of losing progress. It’s a feature that feels liberating and should be more common in the genre.Additionally, the game’s attention to detail in level design is worth noting. Each chapter brings not only new environments but also a fresh aesthetic for objects like chests and altars, giving the world a sense of craftsmanship that goes beyond surface-level visuals. Even the game’s music contributes to this atmosphere, with a memorable moment in the second chapter where a modernized version of traditional music is introduced. The evolving soundtrack adds to the immersion, making each chapter feel distinct.Gameplay-wise, there are several elements that may feel out of place for a Soulslike title. The game lacks a proper block mechanic, relying more on fast-paced action akin to slasher games. While this isn’t inherently bad, it might not sit well with fans of the genre expecting a heavier combat approach. Players focused more on builds through force and block, (if we're talking about classic representatives of the genre). Personally, I found great enjoyment in the mechanics of parrying, where you can catch an enemy's attack in the middle of your own attack.Weaknesses.Despite its strengths, game also suffers from several frustrating design choices.It stumbles with some questionable control schemes. For example, assigning two buttons to sprint – one on the left stick and another on R1 – feels redundant. Important mechanics, like special attacks, could have been mapped to these buttons instead, streamlining combat. There’s also inconsistency in how stamina is used, with it sometimes draining during exploration and sometimes not. This lack of predictability disrupts the flow of gameplay.The second chapter highlights another issue – the vast, open environments that are easy to get lost in. The game seems to take inspiration from titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where exploration leads to a sense of adventure. However, here it feels more disorienting than rewarding, as the player can easily lose their sense of direction. It won't be uncommon to go through the entire location, up to the final boss, and only then start mopping up side activities and quests. Vast spaces is not bad in itself, but the game presses kollichestvo. Of course, this problem is present only in the first playthrough, when you do not know initially what to do and in what direction to move.Bosses.The boss battles in games like this are central part of the experience, though they may vary in quality. The game starts with a somewhat unusual boss encounter where the player is meant to win, regardless of their actions. While this subverts the common Soulslike trope of an unwinnable first boss, it raises the question of why the battle is necessary in the first place if the outcome is predetermined. That said, it’s a classic trick, seen in games. To introduce abilities that will be available later in the game, giving players a taste of future power.The first real boss, Lingxuzi, is excellently designed. His attacks are well-telegraphed, his health isn’t overly inflated, and the design is pleasing. He doesn’t one-shot the player, and the smooth animations make for a very satisfying experience. On a separate note, I did encounter a strange bug after defeating an early boss, Wandering Wraith. A purple orb dropped from the enemy, but I wasn’t able to collect it because I lacked a mentor at that point. After resting at a bonfire, the orb disappeared, though I was able to retrieve it later, so it wasn’t a major issue.However, not all bosses are as well-designed. Later, in chapter 3 Kang-Jin Loong stands out for the wrong reasons. His erratic movement and unclear hitboxes make it difficult to tell when your attacks are landing. Combined with his frequent teleportation and massive health pool, this battle feels more like a test of endurance than skill. Bosses like these detract from the overall experience, making certain encounters feel tedious rather than rewarding.The entire sixth chapter consists of rather uninteresting and overpowered bosses, starting from the very first one. This sudden spike in difficulty feels especially strange and out of place, considering that the whole game up to this point had been fairly easy. Seriously, almost every boss in the game can be beaten on the first or second try. However, it's worth noting that Wukong features one of the best final bosses in the Soulslike genre. The long boat ride leading up to the boss adds a sense of closure and beauty to the entire adventure. The only final boss that can be compared to the The Great Sage's Broken Shell is Isshin Ashina from Sekiro. The final bosses in both games represent the ultimate test of player's skills accumulated throughout the journey. The boss dodges and attacks in sync with the player, and the player counters, creating a perfect combat dance. No joke, this is one of the best bosses I’ve ever fought, and it easily makes up for the lackluster quality of some rare bosses. The only downside of this boss is the taunt animations when the player tries to drink from the flask. This goes against all the instincts developed throughout the game and is simply irritating, especially since the animation cannot be skipped.In conclusionDespite not many shortcomings, Black Myth: Wukong shines in many areas. Its storytelling, though occasionally hard to follow, is rooted in classic mythology and unfolds in a way that gives each chapter its own narrative arc. The side content, while not always perfectly balanced, offers a wealth of activities that encourage exploration. Boss battles, even with some missteps, provide memorable moments, particularly in the final chapters, where the game truly tests the player's mastery of its systems. In its entirety, is an ambitious game that both innovates and surprises in equal measure. The graphical and artistic achievements are undeniable, with a level of polish that many games aspire to this days. The gameplay, feature some unique mechanics and a flexible progression system.Overall, it a game that takes risks and introduces fresh ideas to the Soulslike genre. It’s not without its flaws, but for those who enjoy experimentation and mythological storytelling, it offers an experience worth diving into. While it may not be the definitive Soulslike title, it’s certainly one that leaves a lasting impression. I'm hardly alone in the opinion, that Wukong has a good chance of becoming 2024 game of the year. And it will get this title quite deservedly. I advise everyone to play this wonderful game.",Recommended,6525,40.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

12919,"The only reason I can think of why this game is getting such gleaming reviews is because of how few people actually finished it. After 60 hours, it's finally at and end, and only 30 hours too late.I cannot think of the last time I've played a game more inconsiderate to a players time. This game GREATLY overstays it's welcome. Running to the boss room, then running some more, then running in some circles, then running some more. It's so much fluff. It's pretty graphics so you're supposed to look at it this much? One problem... different mountain, same toilet. Some of the art style and areas are extremely nice, but most are too bland and much, much too vast.Now the combat, oh boy. You're a god (and a god killer). But you're also an idiot. You stagger to EVERYTHING. Your engage distance is pathetic. You're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slow compared to what is going on on screen. This works for the first half of the game, but later you find yourself getting 1-2 shotted or just perma-combo'd. Mind you I beat most bosses in 1 to 5 tries. But every time I lost I always felt cheated. I never learned anything from the bosses. Just spell spam to blitzkrieg damage. *SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD* Oh and chapter 4 bosses gave me ass cancer. Literally unplayable unless you find the chapters secret item and negate his second phase.. either that or enjoy beating your head against the wall with the horrendous frame rate and lights blinding you while you get 2 shotted. And I also had to look up how to progress chapter 6 because the developers thought some obscure, basically unsolvable nonsense is fun. Pretty trash-tier combat overall. Trying too hard to be God of War without any of the finesse. They went with flash over any sort of function.The story and the characters are quite fun and charming.

Still, I kept a close eye on the refund window, only to find myself passing the 2-hour mark with great enjoyment. As a Dark Souls fanatic, I must say this game is a lot of fun and well worth the $60 price. Although it's not exactly a Dark Souls game, it's a refreshing experience, with frequent encounters against mini-bosses and bosses. It's a blast! Stop reading and buy the game.

I put a couple hundred hours into elden ring on my ps5 and everyone knows elden ring is just massive and can be pretty overwhelming at times with crowds of enemies, massive run backs, it can be aggravating. When I first played Black Myth: Wukong I was unsure how I was going to enjoy it. As soon as i started playing I was hooked, the game is absolutely beautiful and I can only play on very high because cinematic puts such a strain on my 4070 super. The story holds up and the cutscenes are pretty seamless so I'm completely immersed. The gameplay is intuitive and you have a lot of room to play around with different builds. The builds in this game actually seem like they make a difference depending on your type of gameplay. Theres always a nearby shrine close to boss fights, and wherever you need one tbh.

12939,"The game is visually very impressive, and many of the bosses have really interesting pattern design to them. However, in the end the game just didn't do it for me. This isn't a strong ""avoid at all costs"" style opinion; I think there are people out there that would find this game fun due to the strength of its visuals and the context of its story. If you're also a person that doesn't often play this style of game, I don't know if you'd also share many of my concerns. But, for me, as a long time action game player, there were a few things that generally turned me off.1) The controls of the game are in a number of places inconsistent in their responsiveness. Breakpoints in combo chains can sometimes be frustrating, especially when you are trying to use the baseline counter system of the game.2) The game is quite linear and features an exceptionally large number of invisible walls. It's often quite unclear whether you can actually are meant to climb up a location or not.3) More of the attack tells than I would like are based on memorization of pattern than on attack recognition.4) The baseline combo often just doesn't feel that good? Since you never fundamentally change weapons you'll for the entire game be working off of the same 5 attack string, and the 4th attack of that string is almost universally the point where the enemies will stop flinching and counter attack you. The consistency of this pattern was so high I could just presume this was the case for every new enemy I foguth.5) The game features a decent number of encounters where you have multiple basic enemies attacking you at the same time, and the combat system doesn't feel super well equipped to dealing with those situations.Overall I do think this is an impressive game in a number of respects, I just didn't enjoy my time with it.",Not Recommended,1497,13.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

12972,"This game is just everything I could've hoped for. Easy 9-9.5/10.I'm writing this right after beating the game. No spoilers ahead.The visuals in this game are beautiful. Just by looking at it, the world feels so real. I heard some of the areas were scans of real life temples - can't confirm that 100%, but it definitely feels like it.You can tell from the sheer detail in the armour and weapons (especially the late-game ones) that the developers absolutely loved making this game. There's so much attention to detail and artistry that has to be original, even if the designs are based on the writings in Journey to the West.The music fits every scene perfectly. It never once distracted me from the gameplay, and helped me keep my immersion that was already drawn by the visuals.The combat is excellent. All of the moves are well-animated and feel fluid and real, both from your character and the enemies. The variety of spells and the skill tree make for emergent strategies that aren't ever explained or forced on the player. There's a variety of boss difficulties, and you can get a feel for how difficult they are from just your first run. They all have unique mechanics and take strategical thinking and precise timing. You often fail, and when you do, you know exactly why. ""I didn't dodge his thrust"", ""My cast got interrupted"", ""I used too many heals"", etc. Every try, you learn something new, until you reach the victory - and boy, is the victory satisfying.The exploration is rewarding while not wasting time. There's always something new to find, and there's rarely dead ends or empty areas. There's a lot of side quests that take just a bit of thought to figure out how to complete, and there's loads of good rewards for doing it.Playing this game has been a throughly satisfying experience, and I'm excited to play NG+.",Recommended,1516,221.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

12995,This is GOTY and its not even close. The game looks beautiful. Combat feels amazing and the cut scenes show a degree of care and appreciation for the original journey to the west story that I have not seen in a long time. The only issue with this game that I have experienced is the frame drops from the pluck of many skill and random stutters but other that that I have had 1 crash and that was after the first hot fix in the game. If you feel you need to understand the original novel of journey to the west to fully understand what is going on in the game don't worry the game more than makes up for it with the way it tells some of the stories in the game and there is also codex in the game where you can read up on some of the characters you meet and their lore. If you are a fan of souls likes or would like to get into souls like but feel like they are too hard this is a good game to start with as it is not too difficult. If you are a fan of journey to the west novel or media that is inspired or covers it like DBZ or monkey magic and wonder if you should buy this game I cannot emphasise enough how much love and respect went into this game.

The game is more or less a boss rush with like 5-10 minute breaks in between them to fight other creatures, discover secrets, get items, or use skill levels.

Just speedrun the mandatory ones by running straight through the chapters and being wary of which bosses you need to kill for achievements.

13029,"As a long-time fan of mythological tales and action RPGs, I approached Sun Wukong: Black Myth with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. Developed by Game Science, this title takes inspiration from the classic Chinese epic, Journey to the West, and reimagines it as a high-octane, visually stunning action game. Having spent several hours traversing its beautifully rendered world, I’m ready to share my thoughts.Visuals and Atmosphere:From the moment you boot up Sun Wukong: Black Myth, you’re greeted with a visual feast. The game boasts an incredibly detailed environment that brings the rich lore of Chinese mythology to life. The character models, particularly Sun Wukong himself, are exquisitely designed, showcasing a high level of craftsmanship in both animation and texture. The dynamic weather effects and lighting add an extra layer of immersion, making the game’s world feel vibrant and alive.Gameplay and Mechanics:The core gameplay of Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a mix of fast-paced combat and exploration, with a heavy emphasis on melee action. The combat system is fluid and responsive, allowing players to chain together combos with ease. Sun Wukong’s ability to transform into various forms adds a unique strategic element to battles. Each form offers different abilities, encouraging players to adapt their tactics based on the situation.However, while the combat is exhilarating, it’s not without its flaws. The enemy AI can sometimes feel inconsistent, with some opponents being overly aggressive while others are surprisingly passive. Additionally, the game’s difficulty spikes can be a bit jarring, particularly for players who might be less familiar with action RPGs.Story and Characters:The narrative of Sun Wukong: Black Myth is both intriguing and somewhat uneven. The game draws heavily from the mythos of Sun Wukong, weaving a story that is both grand and intimate. The lore is rich, and the voice acting adds depth to the characters. However, the plot can occasionally feel disjointed, with some story beats lacking the emotional impact they might otherwise have.Performance and Technical Aspects:On PC, Sun Wukong: Black Myth runs smoothly, provided you have a reasonably powerful rig. The game’s graphics are demanding, but if your system meets the requirements, you can expect a mostly stable experience. There are occasional frame rate dips during intense sequences, but these are generally minor and don’t detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.Final Thoughts:Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a visually impressive and engaging action RPG that offers a fresh take on a beloved mythological figure. Its combat system is both fun and challenging, and the world-building is top-notch. However, it does have some rough edges, particularly in terms of enemy AI and narrative cohesion. For fans of mythological stories and action games, it’s definitely worth checking out. With some polishing, it has the potential to become a true classic.If you’re ready to dive into a world of gods, demons, and epic battles, Sun Wukong: Black Myth is a journey you won’t want to miss. Just be prepared for a few bumps along the way.",Recommended,2660,78.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

13058,"Having finished this game I can say that it is one of my more favorite Dark Souls/ God of War esc game as it has been described. The abilities and spirits you get are fun although for my first play through I found my self using one in particular most of the game as it gave you more defense. The game has a certain level of challenge where if you are into those harder games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne you may find it a bit more on the easy side but for someone like me that is less experienced it was a good taste of that world while not feeling completely unfair. There were some janky hit boxes on some of the larger enemies but I never felt when I died to a boss that it was the games fault and it was just my skill that let me down. I still felt motivated to try again. This game has a lot of secrets in it as well and some can be harder to find without a guide than others which is a bit of a let down because unless you really dig deep and care to search every nook and cranny in each chapter you may miss some of the cooler side bosses in this game and in my opinon some of the more interesting condensed stories. The armor and weapons are a nice change of pace as well, you get a single staff that you upgrade as you want to and for the most part after each boss you get an item that lets you do that or make armor (Its not like Dark Souls where you have to choose its just the boss items either unlock a new staff upgrade or a new armor its never both). Each armor has a set bonus that plays into a certain type of play style which I enjoy and let me really lean into my preferred playstyle. A lot of the bosses are not super hard and most took me only a few tries but then you get to the other few where you need to strategize a bit more, using the pills and picking transformations for specific times, the end boss you need to really strategize for, which was frustrating at times but when you finally beat them it is very satisfying when you see the slow-mo ending. This game is set in the world of ""Journey to the West"" which not knowing that story I didnt feel very lost as they go pretty deep into that lore plus I didnt know what I might have been missing... Knowing Dragonball made it more fun I think (at least for me), as you can see where Akira Toriyama got a lot of inspiration from for that IP. The cutscenes were interesting to watch and I never really felt compelled to skip any. Overall I would say if you aren't interested in a Dark Souls type of game but are interested in this story/concept I would say give this game a chance and you may be surprised, this game isnt anything necessarily groundbreaking but it was a fun story that felt complete and I wanted to see it to the end which was a nice change of pace. The pricing might be off putting for some but it is $10 cheaper than other games that have been coming out at $70.",Recommended,2289,27.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

13062,"Given all the hype and positive reviews, I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I didn't.The game looks great, and the combat LOOKS fun. However, it doesn’t actually FEEL fun to engage with the combat mechanics.It feels like the game is caught between two identities: a cinematic action-adventure and a combat-focused Souls-like. As an action-adventure, the story is too disjointed, and it lacks difficulty settings and more flexible combat mechanics (animation cancelling, etc). As a Souls-like, the combat isn’t precise or refined enough.It seems like the developers aimed to blend elements from games like God of War and Sekiro. While they achieved some level of success, they missed out on the key aspects that make those games truly enjoyable to play.This is NOT a bad game. This is just not what I expected or enjoyed. I might give it another chance some time in the future when it gets a discount. For now, however, I will be requesting a refund.",Not Recommended,804,1.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

In the second phase of the battle of Honghaier (Red Boy, one of Yaoguai kings), after all of clones crashing down, Honghaier may get stuck in the air and can’t land successfully. It directly results the battle being discontinued. There is no way to figure out except for reloading the battle.II. In some situations, equipment and item can’t be displayed normally, equipment and item tabs only show blank background.III. In some situations, UI may disappear after player dismounting Jindouyun (flying nimbus) .IV. One of nearby ranged monster always attacks you if interact with the NPC Shizhongren (Man-in-Stone, one of Characters)I. Invisible walls are overnumerous and unnatural. Some fake trails were just built for gorgeous background and not available for passing through. Please replace those ridiculous fake trails with rocks, trunks, fences or any environment matching things. These invisible walls is ruining our gameplay experience.II. Locking point of some bosses with huge body is illogical. It may mislead player and result ability or spells releasing on wrong position.I. Equipment system is on the perfection point, neither too simple and boring, nor too complicated and difficult. In common games, equipment item is more like ‘disposable item’, those equipment which gather previously will be destroy or just be stored on inventory. In contrast to that, each equipment with its special usage for the battle of special boss in this games. Meanwhile, different equipment/item combination will bring you different combat experience.II. Spark (Ability point) can be reset anytime in the nearest Tudimiao (Land Keeper’ shrine) at none of expense. It encourages players trying more methods to play this game, massively extends the gameplay, especially in second, third or even higher round.III. Category of yaoguai (monster) is varied. Every type of yaoguai with different model and action which can be easily distinguished from one to the other one. Designer didn’t put same mode on most of monster then paint them with different colour (nobody implies God of War hereby, doesn’t it?). It makes players always get fresh experience when they enter next chapter.I. The narration and text of this game belong to ‘rashomon-like’ style. Producers won’t tell players whole story directly. You need to gather NPC’s background information and carefully read them in Yingshentu (Portraits in journal tab) to find final truth behind endless lies, just like a detective chasing clues .II. About disputed ending, I personally consider whatever ‘good’ or ‘bad’ ending it is, the story won’t tell you what is it, it just enlightens you to think about what it should be. Philosophical karma, funny or serious? Can not judge it by a simple word.As a pre-purchase player, I have no idea of how good or bad for the first triple A video game which is base on Chinese classic folklore and ancient culture. I just throw money into slots and wait for uncertain result. Luckily, Game Science does an extreme nice job, bring me a huge surprise! Even with bugs and cons which I partly listed as above. Consider that how small their team size is, and moreover, Black myth: Wukong is their first triple A game, it’s unfair to blame them from head till toe. Don’t be a picky player all the time, be tolerant of these diligent game producers. After this game released, I noticed that some suspicious paparazzi posted their strange opinions everywhere. I think a pure game player should avoid those storms, stay away from publicity, grab a keyboard or controller then hit start button: Hell, it’s a game time!",Recommended,3840,169.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Can't recommend it enough.Play it in the Chinese dub :)As of the date of this review writing, as close to perfection as possible. 10/10",Recommended,329,83.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 14
13179,"After 70 hours, I finally achieved all the achievements in my second playthrough. I was dazzled by the picturesque scenery and tortured by some difficult monsters. The music was so moving that it lingered in my ears for days, and the unfinished storyline left me feeling regretful. When I completed the third playthrough, maxed out six spiritual veins, and unlocked the Monkey King's Easter egg with the words ""Children, I am here,"" I felt a sense of satisfaction and relief.+ Visual Effects- Top-notch art. It really captures the feeling of the forest waves and the misty mountains from ancient poems. I used to think ""can't tell the difference between virtual and reality"" was just a joke, but now it's a reality. The female characters are so beautiful that they make me want to stand up and fight, and political correctness is irrelevant at this moment.- Assets piled up. From a large Buddha statue in a temple to a small stone tablet in the scene, every detail is astonishing. There are a variety of bosses and monsters, and very few are repeated (I counted, excluding the skin-changed monsters and NPCs, there are more than 170 different ones), each with its own unique style.- Interactive effects. For example, when fighting the White Clad Scholar, the water effect will present different ripples with the trajectory of the weapon; when fighting the Bukong, the pages on the ground will dance with the staff; when fighting the Yinhu, the effect of the wind blowing leaves is very impressive... and so on.- Combat performance. For example, the battle with Fata Morgana was explosive, truly like a God of War; the battle with the remnants of the Monkey King was full of action details and many Easter eggs (grabbing the gourd, eating peaches, etc.); the battle with the land of the Flame Mountain was like a painting; the ultra-solution of the split staff also filled with satisfaction... and so on.+ Diverse Music- Shaanxi storytelling. It's really impressive and fits perfectly with the game atmosphere, enhancing the plot. It's a unique experience.- Combat music. For example, the BGM for the Yellow Wind Great Sage and the Monkey King's remnants will change with the boss stage, very passionate; the prelude of the Little Yellow Dragon's BGM is a combined version of his three brothers, the female voice chanting comes from the Red Beard Dragon, and the male voice comes from the Little Black Dragon, the melody comes from the Green Back Dragon; transformation also has its own BGM, such as Guangzhi and the Stone Man, the BGM changes when the transformation occurs, and has a strong Chinese folk music element, each with its own characteristics.- Vocal songs. In addition to the popular ""Reincarnation Incantation"", the impression is also the third chapter's ""Pee"" (Three Realms Four Continents), the fourth chapter's ""Don't Listen"". Especially the ""Don't Listen"" combined with the animation brings back the whole chapter's sense of view. When the ending ""Where is the road leading?"" plays again, I still feel emotional.+ Battle Framework- Learning from others. The game absorbs the essence of many excellent action games. For example, stance switching, collecting and releasing spirit cores (essences), recognizing and breaking GP, continuous dodging and combos Offset, etc. And most of them fit well with the game background and gameplay, such as the monster skills and transformations compared to the 72 changes.- Diverse construction. Although the basic action system is a bit immature, the rich magic, pills, equipment tags, etc., make up for this, plus the zero-cost reset, making it easy to build different BD, very friendly.- Treasure restriction. The side quest can obtain the treasure that restricts the final boss of the chapter, making the originally difficult battle instantly reduce the difficulty, and the experts can also challenge the boss without using the treasure. A genius design, which not only fits the story background but also enriches the battle methods. For example: the fireproof cloak obtained in the first chapter not only restricts the Black Bear Demon according to the setting, but also allows players to move freely on the lava ground of the Flame Mountain and can also restrict other fire-based bosses.- Gourd wine and food. The basic function of the gourd is to drink medicine and drink souls, and can also be matched with the contents of the gourd, a bit like the Drip of Dew from ""The Elder Scrolls"", but with higher diversity, fitting the",Recommended,3748,64.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13185,"TO DARK SOULS FANS:As a die hard Dark Souls fan this is my point of view. This is not a Dark Souls like game, will the Dark Souls fans like it? Yes you will, so if you have any hesitation about it... don't, the game is really good (at least).Here is why this is NOT a Dark Souls game though:1. Dark Souls trademark is being hard from top to bottom and especially boss fights. BMW is not as hard in general areas and apart from a few (very few) boss fights its medium to easy. However! boss fights are really enjoyable since battle mechanics are really really good!2. Dark Souls depends on collecting souls which you drop when you die, in BMW when you die you dont lose anything (takes the stress off but also the edge).3. BMW has only one playstyle and weapon, sure it has 3 staff stances but thats it. Ok much simpler can't complain and I loved, it but you're stuck with it... staff thats it.So in general this is not a Dark Souls like game. It is a GREAT game, beautiful, great battle mechanics and most of all... a really great character, I like that monkey very much... he kicks ass.I've played all Dark Souls games 3 times, and all Dark Souls like games... bought this game as a Dark Souls like, it wasn't...

13186,"Black Myth: Wukong is a fun and amazing ARPG. It's on the easier side in terms of difficulty but atleast the combat is fun and enjoyable. There are a lot of bosses to fight but only a handful of them is difficult. There's a lot of variety with the boss design despite the large quantity. The visual and music is amazing too.My biggest criticism on the game is its level design. Yeah the levels look stunning but it's bad to explore due to the inconsistency on which area is traversable or not. Also, kinda annoying to 100% since some items that are require for achievements is tied to RNG drops from plants that spawn in 30mins interval.Overall, I highly recommend this game.",Recommended,554,56.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Bosses are always surmountable, and the feeling you get when you finally hit that killing blow on your 15th retry of this one mf'er that kept taunting you, is delicious. The game doesn't punish you for dying, there is no loss of experience or damage to gear. In fact, it almost always encourages you to press on, with generously placed shrines (save points) near key boss fights.The story and the way in which it unfolds through animated music videos and ingame cutscenes is raw, untouched by ""today's political agenda"". It hit me in the feels on several occasions (can't remember the last time that happened in a game).Of course the game isn't flawless.

Speaking of big bosses, they will completely screw with the camera angle when focused on them, making battling them a hot mess.Most enemies will throw 2-3 attack combos at you completely depleting your stamina from constant dodging. Most of the time the game just feels annoying rather than difficult. The game isn't all that hard, it's just that everything is thrown at you at once.

13253,"My review page.Follow me on twitch![www.twitch.tv]The gist of it:Do be aware that the majority of the reviews for Wukong are from China, even those in English, and as such this review will probably trigger some. We live in a time where singleplayer games without any kind of bs such as pandering to the far left, microtransactions, and similar trash are rare, so rare that whenever a pure singleplayer game with a pretty hefty budget focuses on the right things releases, gamers will instantly love it and ignore all its faults. Black Myth Wukong is one of those games. I am not one of those gamers. Black Myth Wukong is an extremely average action-adventure game that heavily takes inspiration from games of its genre while not excelling at anything in particular.👍 The good parts:+Certain boss fights are pretty well-designed👎The bad parts:-One of the worst level designs I've ever encountered-Outside of boss fights, there is nothing good-Incredibly boring atmosphereStoryThe story is based on Journey to the West which is a very famous fictional novel in China. It's sadly not a very direct story, similar to God of War, but instead, they decided to go the obtuse route which makes it even worse as the novel itself was already incredibly difficult to follow.Black Myth Wukong's story is more of a giant proverb that heavily focuses on the metaphorical morality of life which felt at odds with itself because, at certain times, it feels like it wanted to be a normal story, similar to God of War or any western media, but then decides to forget it and it starts going into nonstop proverbial dialogues irrelevant to the main story, if we can even call it a story.This is more evident as each chapter has unique cinematics, which were very cool designed, that have a moral at the end, for example, there was this story where a guy finds a wounded fox in the mountains, takes it home to take care of it, it transforms into a beautiful woman and their life begins, however at the end, the woman was actually a demon and she devours his family, but then he wakes up back at the cabin. Realizing the dream was a sign, he kills the fox.These small cinematics were great and the game would've benefited more if they relied on them throughout the chapters, for example being part of the guy's story and the final boss would be the fox demon. Sadly as it is, the story was just average, you have to collect artifacts to become the chosen one, the end. Perhaps for people living in China, it might be more nostalgic than anything else.Story rating: 6.5/10Wukong's gameplay isn't exactly fresh or new and sadly it didn't do anything good or fun up until the end. It copies core mechanics from God of War, Jedi Survivor, and From Software games and mixes them, a jack of all trades master of none.You spam attacks at bosses with tons of health, dodge a few times and that is it. Out of the ""hundreds"" of bosses it has, I can count on one hand the ones that may have required some thinking or learning their attack patterns. A lot of people were dismissive of calling the game a boss rush, however, they are factually wrong because for starters, outside of boss fights, there is absolutely nothing good about the gameplay. The smaller enemies are some of the most boring and uninteresting-designed enemies you've ever faced and are just there to pad the game for no reason.The looting and finding things aspect is average, as most of the good stuff drops from bosses. Sadly since each boss has more and more HP, you're forced to explore and look for mats to increase your damage output else you'll be spending an hour taking down their health. I've never felt a sense of awe or ""wow look at this epic thing I found"" once in the entire game, though I have to give them credit for turning a simple game into a weak RPG as an afterthought. Yes, the game has skill points as you'd expect, and yes most of them are useless.Moving on from the mid aspects of the game, the boss fights is what most people are in for. I say boss fights, but I consider them the average enemy in this game and only a few are actual boss fights. These boss fights are average towards ok. You'll never face anything as terrifying as the likes of Souls games or as amazingly cinematic as the likes of God of War games. To make matters worse, they're all HP sponges, and outside of using a few skills and dodging you're just hitting a wall with your stick.Gameplay rating: 7/10Overall the audio design is decent, I played it with Chinese voice acting and I had no problems with it at all, they all performed quite well. The soundtrack is pretty good, nothing really memorable, but it does a decent job of making the boss fights less boring.As for the rest of the sound effects, nothing really good or bad to say about them. I never felt the environments being alive which would be a minus, but then again, I have a lot of negative things to say about the atmosphere of the game below.Audio rating: 7.5/10The game uses Unreal Engine 5 and as such expect horrible performance if you don't use DLSS or frame generation, expect heavy stutters when the game loads new assets such as boss skills. The worst offenders are the atmosphere and level design.For starters, the game as I mentioned is based on a fantastic fictional novel Journey to the West. If you've seen movies based on it, you might remember some very nice locations and architectural designs. The game has none of that. Instead, you'll be exploring forests and caves that you've seen a million times or outside of your house with a few Buddhist statues and temples copy-pasted for lore reasons. I'm not even joking, watch a walkthrough, that's all you'll ever be in, forests, whether it's dead ones, lush ones, or snowy ones.The second worst offender is the level design. It makes absolutely no sense. If you've played any Dark Souls game you'll know each road you take is masterfully inter-connected to one another, the whole map is a giant playground. Wukong has its main zones split by loadings so they're not connected to one or the other. Furthermore, each zone has multiple paths that lead to nowhere or minibosses making exploration incredibly tedious.The last offender is the input, specifically the reading of it. It's incredibly delayed, certain skills take forever for Wukong to use, for example, you'll have to spam drinks in order for him to actually start drinking them and the same goes for the skills. To make matters worse, certain skills take forever to cast and enemies just attack non-stop which will cancel your skills and put them on cooldown. Sometimes they bugged. It's a mess.Most people will look at the game and say ""Wow look at those graphics, look at those tree leaves flying around you"" and that's all just generic UE5 assets. Everything about the environments felt soulless, like someone generated using ""AI"". Compared to Dark Souls, a game that came out decades ago which on a technical level wasn't that great, Wukong looks incredibly uninspired and would've benefited more if they focused on art rather than pretty trees.Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 5/10I don't think anyones going to even notice this review, since 90% of the reviews are just blindly praising the game and ignoring its faults, but I advise against purchasing it at full price.",Not Recommended,6035,41.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

From a graphical standpoint this game is in the top 3, sound design, soundtrack, gameplay, story. It all fits so well. I`m on my second playthrough, I cleaned up the first run as much as I could, and couldn`t wait to start the NEW CYCLE.The content, weapons, gourds, brews, armours, is in abundance. Characters , allies, enemies, bosses are designed perfectly. Like I said before, the gameplay is addictive, I couldn`t get enough of it.Only downside for me is the lack of a map, or a radar, some chapters are huge and built like a maze, and some kind of a map would be a huge welcome, or you can watch some yt videos for missing secrets like I did. And because of that in my 1st playthrough I missed just ONE BOSS, it made me so mad. Cause I accidentaly went to the final boss before the secret boss, and after that , the secret boss is not there anymore. I got really frustrated. but Ill get him in the NG+.Considering glitches or bugs, I did not encounter anything. Guess I was the lucky one.This game deserves all the praise it got. Rightfully so. It is amazing. AAA devs, take notes pls.I`m giving this game a super solid 9/10only because confusing level design (CHAPTER 3 and 4) and some collectible items that are 0.50% of random drops.

13285,"A hearty recommendation, it's fun and enjoyable. There are some great story beats if you are passingly familiar with the characters and setting of Journey to the West and gave me a greater appreciation for the source text.This is not a souls game but it does borrow a few elements from them. There are multiple ways to approach a problem and easy ways to respec if you hitting a wall. The combat is simple and easy to grasp but has greater skill heights. Probably closer to an action fighter style with emphasis on big bosses.The world is stunning from start to finish even running on a low spec pc that lends itself to more quiet moments to reflect amidst the frenetic game play. The space isn't used to its fullest at times and the invisible walls do offer some frustration.Wukong rewards you for your investment with its story and mechanics, there is lots to explore as the maps open up more later int he game.Fun Monkey game good, give it a try it may surpriseBajie is best bro",Recommended,804,105.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I've been hearing a lot of people talking about Journey to the west Novel when this game get released which I really liked it and it also give a big inspiration to some good old series like Dragon Ball and One Piece. I've seen tons of gameplays of it since 2020 and even though they keep changing some of it witihin the years still doesn't disappoint.The bosses' difficulty are fair and square, pretty much a boss rush because the destined one is searching all of his 6 relics to become the next monkey king, that's what makes a good characteristics of Sun Wukong because he's playful and loves challenge with his foes alot. What's even more rewarding is that you beat the bosses while testing out the staff stances, armor upgrades with unique stats, weapon upgrades, and more importantly that some bosses gives you the ability to transform into them and you can be able to exploit their hacks and skills! Also In death there's no bad penalty, so you can freely die and respawn the latest checkpoint near to boss' area and configuring out your mistakes.

13349,"I presume that every Chinese knows about who is Wu Kong, and so am I. Based on Journey to the West, one of China’s most iconic and influential works of literature, this game produce a masterpiece for games around the world. I don't want to put much attention to the striking visuals of exciting combat system which you must definitely know if you have tried this game. However, What impressed me most is the cultural connection with me, which I have never had before.I have experienced many great Western-developed games like God of War or Red Dead Redemption 2. To be honest that their combat mechanics or art design are not worse than this game, even better at some point, but I don't think that I can fully comprehend the story and setting of the game due to the cultural difference. With creative reinterpretation, Black Myth Wu Kong inherit the spirit of the original work and depict a character vividly on the screen, a character who is well known by all of the Chinese players. It is a novel experience for us, that is also why it deserves such a high evaluation.And finally, may we can see more like this in the future.",Recommended,925,108.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Once you are used to the gameplay and with the addition of the talents, basic mob aren't a problem anymore.Boss are something else. You have plenty of them. Not juste one per chapter + an half-chapter boss.All those boss are part of the story or various stories actually (can't spoil that) but also give you various spells or abilities. It is the greatness and the problem of the game as difficulty isn't balance depending on the chapter you are.No, chapter boss aren't the hardest (sometimes), and there isn't a linear progression of difficulty, especially when you factor your talent and gear progression.This is the only problem I have with the game.Outside of that, yes the game isn't easy and there isn't a difficulty option. It mean you sometimes need to die and retry (a lot).Again, I'm not a souls fan, so my skill with that kind of game is what it is, but I end up finishing the game, for what it worth.On the positive side, game is beautiful, there is tons of little stories to read (compendium of some sort) and the atmosphere is absolutely unique.I don't believe that it is a GOTY as there is a layer of narrative that miss, compared to a BG3 (last year GOTY), but it is an excellent game.Deserve all praise.",Recommended,1091,65.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The combat mechanics at its basic is very simplistic, but the implemented advanced combat features are very well done such as the ""seeing through"" and the ""focus"" accumulation for the ""heavy attacks"" and ""varied combos"" promotes you in playing aggressively. It reminds me more of Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden 2 than God of War in essence ; as in the combat flow and clutch reaction. Unlike many, I think the enemies difficulty are just fine, where some bosses cheese you with unavoidable and spamming them i think its great, like im really going against deities and demons. They're supposed to be OP.The story is great, it may not be straight forward like your typical Hollywood presentation, being Asian I appreciate and understood the philosophical approach and delivery.Soundtrack is beyond amazing, I feel immersed in every moment in combat and adventuring every new area.I hope Game Science will deliver something just as great if not something more extraordinary in the future.P.S.

13397,《黑神话：悟空》的游玩体验非常好。游戏从环境、音乐、动画演出、剧情、动作和可玩性等诸多细节上给我带来了顶级的享受。这里只列举一二。环境方面，游戏成功营造了各章节特色的氛围的同时，还巧妙地利用了现有的中国文物原型，完美地填充了环境上虚虚实实的细节，可谓巧夺天工。中国博大精深的文化也不需在此赘述，品就完事了。音乐除了体现在每个场景的背景外，还和动画演出完美地结合了起来，让沉浸感进一步增加。此外，游戏的配音也是一大特色，特别是第三章最终boss的配音，让我感受到了配音演员和单纯配音的区别，完美地演绎了boss的内心世界，让我内心也不禁回响起阵阵直击灵魂的拷问。还有一个台词颇多的隐藏boss，可以从他和主角不同形态的多样台词和交互中感受到《西游记》百回本原著中二人那份惺惺相惜的情谊。甚至在使用某个角色后，对方会直接讲出自己的背后的小动作，解释了原著第六十三回为什么行者见到对方会叫“大哥”，甚至把酒言欢。动画演出方面，游戏将打斗中每个主要头目的特点、剧情相关的细节都淋漓尽致地展示了出来。特别是游戏的最后1到2场主要的战斗，绝对称得上是史诗级演绎，甚至会让人觉得，输给对方是情理之中。特别是当专属的BGM响起时，你会觉得这一路的努力都是值得的。此外，在每个章节的结尾，都会有一场精心制作的动画演出。这些章末动画制作之精，可以说不逊专业的影视级动画。作为剧情的补充，这些动画承接了《西游记》百回本的剧情，同时延申到游戏改编的部分，一定程度上补充了原著的一些内容。其中，第三章的内容尤其引人深思。这样让人静下来去思考的内容，在信息爆炸、自媒体铺天盖地的现在，是非常可贵的。剧情方面，非常感动。这个游戏的剧情在原著的基本设定上做了一定程度的改编，剧情事实上包括人物的台词、小传等文本、动画甚至是环境。在通读了这些所有的剧情后，可以感受到那个从石头里出来，不知天高地厚的猴子，从一心求长生、作恶闯祸、取经修心成长、到悟空的心路历程。在不同的时期，面对的“相”不同，但都是在抗争。如果无法理解游戏的剧情改编，也不妨当作说书人眼中的一个解读，走完说书人口中的西游路。如果你有过类似的成长经历，从不羁到克己再到幻灭，斗罢艰险，却又要出发，或许会跟这个游戏的改编有些许共鸣。也许即使历经种种困难，你依旧有一些想要抗争的东西呢 :)动作和可玩性方面，出于设定，尽管主人公没有特别多样的武器，但可以通过使用同一类型武器不同的姿势，来实现不同的打击方式，应对不同的怪物。这一设定也巧妙地和一些中国的武打动作结合了起来。同时，不同的打斗动作结合不同的技能也会衍生出各具特色的玩法。这使得一些游戏操作不是很好的玩家，比如我自己，可以通过想一些其他的办法来解决眼前的难题。这也和原著中，行者解决路上各种困难一样，未必每次都是直来直往，很多困难都是巧妙利用对方的弱点，甚至寻求自身之外的一些帮助度过难关。同时，多周目的存在，也让相对熟练的玩家可以尝试不同特点的玩法，进一步丰富可玩性。总之，《黑神话：悟空》是我目前玩过的最让我满意的单机游戏，余音绕梁。,Recommended,1261,155.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13400,"I 100% the game, but I still would not recommend it.Pros;- Looks good- Combat is responsive- Some fun bosses- Free respeccing to try everything- Interesting customization on the healing gourdsCons;- Loading assets during cut-scenes so choppy audio and video- Inconsistent difficulty- Some really tedious bosses, I don't want to watch you fly around the arena for 30 seconds and do nothing but dodge, wait until your 18 attacks combo is done and then throw 2 or 3 hits in before the cycle repeats- THE INVISIBLE WALLS- No meaningful decisions for character progression, everything feels samey / borderline useless- Boring crafting and equipment- Most modifiers are qualitative instead of quantitative. Ex; Slightly boosts attack after a perfect dodge. Moderately reduces damage from poison. Just tell me the exact numbers so I can judge if I want to wear / use it or not- NG+ is easier than the first playthrough- The story was told through poems and was super confusing to me. I get that we are collecting relics to revive Wukong, but why is everyone trying to stop us? Who are all those bosses? Why are we teleporting to new areas every chapter? *shrug*- Combat gets quite repetitive, but I guess that's to be expected with these types of games- I personally thought the music was either uninteresting or even annoying at times- The camera has no transparency; so if you stand in front of the tree, you'll see the tree, not the boss you're fighting- Some bosses will straight up be invincible with auto-lock because your monkey brain cannot target legs, just chests and heads...TLDR; Don't listen to all the fanboys, it's not GOTY. Look up some videos about the game and make your own decision to see if this one is for you. It's not bad, but it's definitely not even in my top 5 this year. There are just too many little annoyances that add up for me to call it a great game.",Not Recommended,1551,68.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

This game was absolute CINEMA 😭🙏Words cannot express the adrenaline I felt fighting the final boss (I died too many times, but we don't talk about that). The game mechanics are unique and difficult to master. The animations for yaoguai are so fluid and life-like. You can clearly tell the hard work these passionate developers have put into this wonderful game. The character design is absolute peak, the armors, weapons, accessories are simply beautiful and very royal. The stories behind each character are very well written, and can we take time to appreciate the Music Videos for the end of each chapter?! The effort that went into the animation must've been insane, its so high quality (ESPECIALLY chapter 5) and the stories they depict are so meaningful. Definitely a game that I would recommend to everyone along with the likes of Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, you get the idea. Super SUPER awesome game, and I look forward to any future releases Game Science might have for us. They managed to make a game everyone (except those hit-piece writers 💀) loves and enjoys in the gaming industries current state of online/multiplayer/cash-grab low effort games.

13455,"The official partner of this game is sony playstation. So the developers, software of the game is rigged against eveyone else. your will have worst experience with your hyper expensive PC which costs 10x than a playstation. You will have a decent experience with a controller + PC but the only way to enjoy this paid game is buy a playstaion, not even xbox because it is not yet on xbox. This is why 99.99% of all tutorials, guides for this game are done on controllers.This is a perfect crime because nobody can prove it since the software isn't opensource. To make it seem difficult or challenging they have removed consistency for the enemy hit box, damage dealt or taken. To force you to think that it is tougher, challenging and not easy and challenge bait people, irrespective of how good you are, if you are winning too soon, you get nerfed and enemy gets boosted. Once you have spent enough time with an enemy, then the AI slowly weakens the enemy to let you move on. Lazy result oriented programming. They should give at least 99% discount to PC players since we are being victimised for having a superior hardware.I have 2 logitech gaming mice. 1 with g pro (2 extra buttons near the thumb), another is logitech 502 x lightspeed with more buttons. This game doesnt allow us those buttons. If I try to map any of these buttons, even from a MOBA mouse, it says this button cannot be customised. All games, even decade old games allowed us to use extra buttons on the mice, why not this game?! Unless it affects the sales of the controllers which is one step away from going to a console completely.on 4080rtx gpu. Set everything to low. If this game can play in full glory on a console with much weaker gpu then why not on PC? They also are pushing for controllers (xbox/playstation), you get their promotion to use a controller before you begin the game. You might not think much of it when you start playing it, you realise that those with weaker hardware than you (consoles), those with fewer buttons than you to play with (controllers) are getting a better experience than you. It only means one thing. The game engines themselves or the games are rigged against the non controller gamers aka pc gamers. Most of the time button to do some action dont register. You will find that most vloggers online are uploading their content mostly from a controller.influencers using a controller, game itself is asking you to use a controller, a weaker hardware (controller+console) getting a better experience than your PC?! These games seems to be just pushing for consoles. We aren't buying the product. We are paying to be the product to buy other products. Overall game is 6/10. no biggie.The fact that it doesnt has basic 20 year old features of a videogame to map buttons on mice or use mice extra buttons is very anti paying customer.The fact that when we use gaming mice software, create custom mapping and play the game, it blocks that too by making it inconsistant.All these things to cripple PC gamers and boost consoles. If So, then you should be charging half price to PC customers who with a superior more expensive hardware has to put with a worse gaming experience.All the so called youtube gamers who make videos are these are mainly using controllers, why? because the game forces you to do so. Now you to will start self doubting yourself, your PC, your peripherals and tricked into buying controllers, then buy a console for the controller and then buy a TV for the console and then move into a bigger house with hall to put that TV in? wth.The gaming experience isfor pc+keyboard+mouse players = 6/10.for pc+controller = 8/10for consoles = 9/10.The non coding artists of this game (script, storyline, character design etc.,) =10/10coding team = 6/10.You are essentially buying a forced promotion or marketing campaign for1. consoles2. controllers3. unreal engine 54. new super expensive graphics card, even though your graphics card is 10x better than the console, console+controller gives you better experience. This is why 99% of all guides for this game are by controller/console users. They have rigged it for keyboard+mice players but charging the same money for us. they should at least give 99% discount for us.This strategy to sell a product to force market other products isn't new. may be we should stop buying any game which comes after the release of the graphics card we have brought in.The boss fights are not hard but lame and rigged. Every game has enemies with fixed set of patterns and each patter has a fixed number of strikes and each strike has a fixed amount of damage but here the goal for the developers is to make you think that the game/villain is hard and they have done this not by innovative mechanics but by making the damage dealth by the strike a variable which depends on how much time you have spent against the villain and how much life you have left in so that they can increase the damage if you ? To gain popularity as the toughest game to beat or play and also it generates a lot of buzz from guide makers online at the expense of paying customers.If you are a keyboard+mice player, wait for 10 years and you will get it at a fair prize and your PC hardware then will be able to match the console hardware of 2024.I understand why they didnt want maps, but they should have at least area coverage maps like ori 1 & 2 had so that we get to explore everything and know what we missed out.Many a times enemies kill you with one shot, many a times the same enemy just stands there, extremely inconsistent.",Recommended,4577,255.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

BOSS设计很特别，数量很多，打得非常过瘾。5. 高自由度的战斗。玩家可以随时重值技能树，基本属性，迎合不同的敌人。6. 剧情令人向往。后西游记的故事引人入胜。7. 地图和关卡设计都很棒，尤其第一回到第四回。8. 最终BOSS战创造历史，绝对是神作！9. 过场动画令人印象深刻。缺点1. 小小小小小瑕疵。后期小兵只是换个皮肤。然而小怪种类本来就很多，这只是小瑕疵。2. 第五回是直线地图，玩起来比较单调。敌人比较弱，不够挑战性。3. 第六回小型开放世界效果还好，没有被惊讶到。整体来说，玩了多年游戏，【黑神话：悟空】展示了另一种高度和游戏体验。BOSS战惊心动魄。优点远远超越瑕疵。个人评价：10/10 经典神作。游戏界的新里程碑！,Recommended,386,135.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13508,"This is my first time playing a game like this. Was never into these types of games. I love the story of Sun Wukong and that's what brought me to this game. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I have. I didn't see any previews, watched no trailers, and have been blown away. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I even went back and purchased the DLC so that I could have all the content. Love how there isn't a skin store, battle pass, and its most certainly not pay to win. Developers hit this out of the park. This game is a must play",Recommended,449,235.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 14
13509,"For context, this is my first game review I've ever posted. However, I definitely feel this game is worth the effort for a quick little blurb from a casual enjoyer. First off, I don't agree with calling this a Souls-like and I personally feel that tag should be removed. HOWEVER, with the features and mechanics that are in-place, I understand why it is referred to as a Souls-like, but the implementation of said features and mechanics (More on that later) do NOT align with tag in my opinion.Anyway, back to review. If you are on the fence about purchasing, JUST DO IT. Within the 2 hour refund window, I'd say you can experience about 80% (conservatively) of the core game-play mechanics. If you don't like the game itself or the game-play loop after 2 hours, then you are not going to enjoy the rest of the game period. With that said, If you do find yourself enjoying the early game, just wait, it gets even better once you start leveling and building out The Destined One. There are many great aspects to this game that I personally love, but the 2 greatest features that I believe truly open this game up for everyone is the refundability of sparks (ability/upgrade points) at LITERALLY any point and the zero punishment of death. These 2 features are also a large part in why I feel this game is NOT a Souls-like. Personally, regardless of how you think the game should be labeled or tagged, It's just a great freaking game and a ton of fun to play.Hopefully my first review can help some of you off the fence, even though I know I didn't really ""Review"" the game lol.Give it a shot, you might be surprised.",Recommended,1323,37.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

This game is a wake-up call to the entire gaming industry: More game, less ""woke"", No microtransaction nonsense.I completed the game with 100% journal completion and defeated every single boss, including the secret ones. They nailed it in every way—beautiful graphics, fluid animations, stunning music, great voice acting, and incredible environmental design.Hats off to Game Science.◾GraphicsBeautiful. They did an amazing job here.◾GameplayVery good. Monkey business done right—9/10.◾Audio**Very good.**👌 The sound effects, especially the whoosh of a perfect dodge, are incredibly satisfying.◾PC RequirementsHigh-end. You’ll need a strong rig to fully appreciate the stunning environments.◾DifficultyVery challenging. Patience is key. You need to enjoy and embrace every fight to get the most out of the game.◾GrindExtensive skill tree. If you want to maximize your gameplay experience, improving your skill tree is essential. This requires grinding through high-experience enemies as much as possible.◾StoryRich and immersive. The storyline might be tricky for some to follow, but having knowledge of the novel Journey to the West and the lore of Sun Wukong and his allies enhances the experience. Game Science did a fantastic job creating an original continuation of the classic story.◾Game TimeAround 40+ hours.◾PriceAbsolutely worth it.

I spent some time killing few bosses but there is no reward/satisfaction from killing them(besides better gear) and a feeling: ohhh I finally won after 100 deaths. There is no story around the bosses, just another body to beat, and the next one is probably going to be more difficult with more magical skills, but nothing that drives me to continue.I appreciate the thought and effort that was put into this game, graphics and animation is really amazing, but this game is lacking something that would make me want to continue.",Not Recommended,548,16.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The combat is fun and you run into so many bosses to fight. I keep getting stuck on a boss, going to bed, then comeing back the next day to beat it after work.Over the past few years we have had some really stand out games.

Every level felt relevant because regardless of what skill I took I felt like my character was improving- Internet Not Required. Internet dropped out one day and I never even noticed which is rare these days- cinematics were beautiful. There was not a single cut scene or dialogue I wanted to skip.- Unique Story.

13539,I really wish combat was better - for a game with amazing set pieces its really sad so many bosses just are so unrewarding.

As well as they suddenly are immune to your spells making the only option light attacks.

This is better than I ever imagined it could have been. An absolute Cinema experience that fired on all Cylinders like dual wielding revolvers with infinite ammo. From The masterful gameplay that was engaging and fast paced. To the Insane graphics and environmental design. Not enough Diversity? What a joke that is huh? There is plenty of diversity in this game. With interesting characters each with their own designs and personalities. Bosses with insane movesets and interesting combat abilities. Different weapon and build diversity for unique creativity. Changing the combat and evolving the experience. Respec is also free which is unheard of and such a breath a fresh air. Its a 10 Folks.

13617,"The game I’ve been waiting for!Everything about it screams quality, from the stunning visuals to the smooth combat mechanics. The game captures the essence of an epic adventure while paying attention to what players really care about – engaging gameplay, challenging bosses, and a story that pulls you in. It's clear that a lot of passion went into crafting this experience, and I can't wait to see what more it has in store.

13618,"Not worth the $60 in my opinion. I've got a lot of time clocked in to all souls and souls-like and I understand this is not one of those games but it doesn't do adventure well, does not do combat well and pretty much any category of game is does not do well. adventuring is limited, no open areas, just different alley ways for you to go down and never really learn the area. combat is light attack and that's it. People will argue it has heavy attacks in there, but bosses are designed to dodge them or prevent charging so it's never really reliable. No metrics or UI elements to help you understand how your skill points are actually helping, just says moderately or slightly increases attribute.Bosses are by far the worth thing of the game. ""git gud, git gud"". For me on all my souls experiences getting good was enjoyable. I could get different weapons, I could spec entirely differently, I could learn attack patterns, etc. This game is not fun to get good at. No I-frames for dodging, getting hit likely leads to more getting hit, the attacks of (a lot) of bosses are just ridiculous, the amount of screen breaking moves are crazy, and they are so damn tanky. Each run takes about 10 minutes, so if you get stuck on a boss you'll be there an hour.For what they do well. Cut scenes, character design, graphics, frequency of incense holders. That's about it, but those things are flawless, but for a game genre I typically find incredibly enjoyable I have been frustrated more time in the 19 hours of this game then the collection 100 hrs I have in Elden Ring. In all fairness I don't understand why this is getting such good reviews and without understanding their perspective I feel I can't truly rate the game, but for now I'd give it a 3/10.",Not Recommended,1431,30.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I know i shouldnt be taking this too serious but the story is literally switching things up so much that it ruins the whole story of Journey to the west. They modernified everything making it look like the gods are the evil ones even tho that wasnt the point of the story. But if you just ignore the story or if you never even grew up with journey to the west then i would recommend this game since it wont bother any of you guys as much as it did for me.

This game is not bad at all and is very good which is why i tried so hard to make it work but it just didnt after all my attempts, stupidly though i left the game in main menu while rushing to look up ways to at least run the game for nothing; this made the game go over its 2 hour refund time and i have got nothing from steam leaving me with a literal useless game i cant even play. good job steam :Thumbs_up:",Not Recommended,593,4.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13659,"Despite the overwhelming positive reviews I can't for the life of me share that opinion. Visually everything looks nice, but calling it stunning is a bit over the top. The art style is unusual and therefore catching, but in itself nothing that has blown me away compared to other titles.I can't talk about the culture or history behind it, as I don't know anything about it. While it may be a positive point for everyone who is familiar with it, I can't imagine that being the selling point to push through this game.The maps are way too complex to comfortably explore. While movement gets restricted quite often through invisible barriers, other times you walk through huge areas where literaly nothing waits for you.Small enemies are mostly irrelevant, as they die pretty quickly. To compensate that, while progressing the game more and more of them are placed in positions you can't reach or where fighting is almost impossible ( for example archers on cliffs or enemies right next to a small bridge or a ledge) The idea is nothing new but the frequency gets way too much.The main point is the numerous bosses. You spend way more time fighting bosses than exploring, not only because you get stuck at bosses but also because of their sheer amount. At the beginning it felt like a nice new touch but a couple chapters in and I am absolutely sick of it. Every boss feels like a chore. You have to learn movesets over and over and over again, just so 5 minutes later the next boss arrives. I feel completely burnt out playing this game for a while. ""Yes I did it!"" became ""Thank god that's over"" most of the time for me.This is made worse by the whole movement of everything. Enemies like to delay their attacks and seemingly hang in the air. Sometimes they hardly move at all, sometimes they move like gliding on ice despite taking a single step and covering the distance of the whole arena. The attack frequency can get absolutely nuts and you spend like half a minute doing semi perfect dodges before you can do anything again. While on the other hand, most of the time you get about 2 to 3 hits in before they just start attacking again while ignoring everything you do. Hit boxes also get quite weird as you are getting pushed back while attacking sometimes (for example everytime while using the spear or in particular while fighting the chapter 4 endboss). So you don't just have to learn their moveset but also whats kind of quirky in their fight. On the other hand our own moveset is pretty limited and with not much variety at all. Either you are into it or you are stuck with it for the whole game. Instead you customise stats, buffs and a few gimmicks to support your basic moveset. You can respec at any time which is great. But it also feels like it doesn't matter much anyway.All in all I don't really know the target group for this game. Definetly not recommended for anyone who just wants to play a bit casually. But it also feels not really worth to put a lot of effort in, at least for me. I gaslight myself to continue playing in order to get my moneys worth, but looking back I definetly wouldn't buy it again.",Not Recommended,2564,46.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13675,"Honestly good. You may think it's a souls-like but it has its own unique flavor that makes it stand out. It's really polished and cared for. From the visuals to the sound design to the boss fights. The story/narrative and how it is told is remarkable.I really liked the gameplay, from the basic light combo to dodging to using spells and reading the enemy. It improves and changes as you progress through the skill tree. I didn't see the point in using the other stances (apart from smash) and anyway, I didn't have the points to improve them either, so that was sad. Between this, the relics and the equipment you could tailor the gameplay to your playstyle. I think the inventory progression could have been a bit more gradual, as I felt I only got new things from chapter to chapter.As other hard, boss fight based games, it is tough, sometimes too much. You get frustrated and consider dropping it altogether. I always dislike this part, but there ca be joy in the challenge. Same thought as with Souls, I think a difficulty option doesn't hurt anyone, even though true chosen fans will blast me into oblivion for this opinion.A step forward for chinese-based games, and a really nice portray of sun wukong's story. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the lore and understanding the narrative.Congrats to the devs, an looking forward to where this goes next :)",Recommended,1127,31.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I hate the cast, I hate how overhyped it is, I hate how boring the movie actually turned out to be; but most of all, I DESPISE the people that say that you have to had read the books in order to grasp and comprehend the movie. As if my opinion is somehow less valid for not partaking in complimentary activities about the media I am consuming. As if it wasn't fair to expect that a piece of art should be able to stand on its own. I think that is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Personally, I have never been able to finish reading a complete book, let alone a 1000 page book like Dune (I have a broken sense of attention like most of us do today). So to me, when someone manifests to my face a finger-waggy, ""morally superior"", mounted-on-a-high--white-stallion, holier than thou READ THE BOOK FIRST OR ELSE opinion, I kinda lose my ♥♥♥♥. The movie sucks bro. The characters are super bland, the events feel unimportant, the performances are weak (the photo is pretty good though). You can't expect me to excuse it being trash under the excuse that reading the book will suddenly make it amazing. The OG Lord of the Rings didn't have that problem. Neither did Fightclub, neither did No Country for Old Men (and many more examples). Thankfully though, neither does Black Myth: Wukong.I am a huge believer that if something is actually good, you don't need to understand the innerworkings of it to experience and identify that it is good. Think of a great meal you had recently - or better yet, think of a great song you heard. Think of the intense feelings it gave you. Bask in the meadows of multicolored worlds that it allowed you to travel. Think of how it made you remember that one time when your mom picked you up from school and took you to McDonalds. It feels good doesn't it? At worst, it FEELS. It makes you feel things. The mere existence of it makes you understand that you are in awe and you feel a towering presence looming over you. This is how good art feels. Whether its food or music or a videogame. You don't need to understand how its cooked, how its composed or in this case; you don't need to read a 3000 page book to witness what a great game Black Myth is.Rant aside, this is a game that is based on a very old chinese novel, a Journey to the West. The novel is hugely influential since it served as inspiration to birth many of todays most beloved characters (Goku from DBZ and Luffy from One Piece for example). Something that you definitely don't have to know to enjoy the game, although (despite my rant before) it does add some context for the aesthetics and a lot of context for the story. It's very refreshing to play a game that feels so good in its mechanics, but that is also not a western game. I feel like sometimes chinese games have the stigma that they are going to be cheap or mobile game-like, but in reality I found that this game plays a lot like a very polished bloodborne.I always enjoyed games that are submerged in mythological lore and to me the chinese myth lore has always been extremely deep and vast. There are many archetypes that are portrayed beautifully in the game and the many characters that appear in it. It always brought a smile to my face to witness the cartoon like joy and naiveté of certain characters during the adventure. I feel like games that are rooted in ancestral stories are always bound to feel very related, especially when they're done in an artsy way and when other videogame elements like combat mechanics and progression don't stand in the way of it.The combat, like I mentioned before, reminds me somewhat of bloodborne. (Think of a bloodborne and devil may cry blend) There is a lot of dodging and a lot of fast paced mechanics. The destined one (which I forgot to mention is our silent hero in this case), carries a huge assortment of spells and maneuvers that never make the combat feel stale. You can also turn into many types of Yao Guais (how the mobs are referred to in this game) you defeat and capture along the way, allowing people that really like to switch up the gameplay, have a new set of tools to try every so often. The variety of bosses and mobs in this game is just astounding. I wouldn't fault you if you thought that this game was more of a boss rush at first, just due to the fact of the sheer amount of bosses you get to fight as soon as the game starts.This is no dark souls though. Most bosses, even when looking and moving in a very intimidating way, weren't extremely difficult to defeat. I was able to tear through most (♥♥♥♥ you Erlang) of them in one or two tries. Sometimes three. Thankfully I think this is a really good plus for the game. Having many bosses that are beatable and feel fair really gives the player a strong dopamine boost to keep playing. The game also rewards you a lot with items to craft armor and weapons fairly consistently and I mention this because everything looks really beautiful. I mean, I know that ""receiving materials for crafting"" sounds possibly incredibly boring or mundane, but in this game it always feels like it's something you earned - and I am not sure if it was because the game was made in unreal engine 5, but EVERYTHING looks beautiful. The feedback for getting items. The bosses, the environments. Really pristine - and honestly It only hits so hard because the game is really good. Looking good on its own rarely does good things.Now, I kinda get why the devs did this, but I actually do not understand at all the lack of a map in this game. Despite it not being an open world game, you get lost ALOT. Sometimes you want to advance a sidequest or you're exploring part of the map and suddenly you unknowingly advance the main story and get thrown out of the area. Part of the reason this is hard to deal with is because the story is very dense and very hard to follow. You need sometime to unpack the things that happen or maybe follow sidequests to distract yourself from the main thing. I found myself constantly being betrayed by my muscle memory only to realize I had paused the game looking for a map for the 100th time. I know many games do this too, but if you play it, you will see how easily you will get lost. It's not a great feeling.After many hours and many many many boss fights, there's a section at the end of the game where the map opens up a bit more and you get to fly on top of a cloud like Goku - and that's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome.I know I always complain that reviewing really long games is hard for me - and this game is no exception. There's always a lot to say and unpack especially if the game inspires me to talk about different themes that contain more things than just the game. Sometimes it feels overwhelming and this game is truly an overwhelming game. You have to take the time and play it over several weeks to really immerse yourself in this world and the story. One that is truly worth it and will leave you marked with the archetypes that us humans have kept alive by telling stories over many generations. Stories that have reached our modern day and are told in such a way that bring us value and tools for effective introspection.Thank you if you reached this part of my review. It was really cathartic to write and If you are on the fence about this game, I really hope you give it a shot.I would def give it 4.5 一只被选中的猴子 out of 5 🐒🐒🐒🐒",Recommended,6048,50.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13753,"Extremely Fun game, with great mechanics. I would describe it as more of a souls-lite than a souls-like. There were a few times when I had to stop out of frustration like in Chapter 2.The game is the aftermath of Journey to the West the book the game is based on. Wukong made a lot of enemies and a lot of messes on his adventure. You are “fixing” his past mistakes on your way to becoming him. You meet all the people Wukong once met on his adventures and some are trying to kill you and your people because they believe one of you is the reincarnation of Wukong.You will most likely want to give up on Chapter 2. A shocking amount of the bosses in there are souls-like hard but after that, most of it will be one or two hard bosses per chapter the rest will be challenging but not pull your hair out hard. I highly suggest if you feel as if nothing works on a boss, go and fight something else and come back. The number one reason people give up is because they try to fight one boss for hours, make zero headway, and get bored. Trust me, leave and come back later he’s not going anywhere.",Recommended,880,28.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

13759,"First of all there is for sure many things to praise the game for, and clearly a lot of work and passion went into it when it comes to animations, sound design, vistas, the combat is pretty fun although it got repetitive fast for me after like 20 hours. I will definitely finish it at some point, just did not get so hooked as I'd hoped.The single most frustrating thing for me was the invisible walls which are often placed in spots which really seem reachable. Combine that with not having any kind of map, and a bit boring level design and it makes navigation more frustrating than it has to be. You can go through the linear path relatively easily but the game has a bunch of secrets which makes you want to check every corner, which will often result in you bumping into invisible walls.You're playing as a shapeshifting monkey but can't even traverse over simple objects, it would have been nice if the barriers of the level were more obvious, or at least there was a map of some kind.For me that just lead to me not looking forward to exploring the next area, and that's why I did not finish it yet.Also keep in mind if you don't have the most powerful PC, it can look pretty bad on lower graphical settings, which can kind of diminish the appeal (as there are a lot of beautiful sights to be seen, which for sure can still look decent on lower graphics).

13799,"I have no experience in such games. When I bought the game, I read in the reviews that the bosses are quite simple and there is no constant grind in the game. In fact, the game is not linear. Every time you get stuck on a “big” boss, it turns out that somewhere earlier you had to complete some kind of quest to find a certain thing against that boss. Without YouTube guides, most of these quests are impossible to find. It's not interesting to die 50-100 times from 1 boss. I'm shocked that in a game like this there are players for whom boss hits are predictable. Often, the animations of the boss's attack do not coincide with the actual damage. Are you evading? Take the damage! Are you standing next to an afk boss so he can finish you off? The boss misses by some miracle!There are no difficulty levels in the game, so if you don't have experience in such games, don't even try. Playing the game is like an emotional roller coaster where you have fun for a while until you get to the boss, which will take you a hundred attempts. It's not fun.I'll try to structure the biggest disadvantages:1) The bosses' damage animations don't always match the actual hit. You can get damage when you're out of range, or you can avoid damage even if you're physically in the area of impact;2) The game does not try to teach you how to play it. When you buy this game, you should already have experience in similar games. Otherwise, the passage will be hell;3) The terrible use of heal. You press a button and the game doesn't respond. You click again - the game doesn't respond. You click again - the game uses the heal twice;4) If you watch a walkthrough on YouTube and think it's easy to dodge, don't get your hopes up. Just like with the heal, the dodges don't always obey you either. It feels as if the game has an in-play lag;5) The game lures you in with beautiful movies at the start. I love it, so I decided not to refund, but later on, there are practically no movies in the game. The game just throws mobs at you in a monotonous circle to kill without explaining anything;6) Terrible lip-sync spoils the whole experience of conversations between characters.",Not Recommended,1762,42.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

The story is NOT simply fed to you via narration / exposition, and takes the entire game (including the now not so Secret Ending) to fully flush out.It will take multiple play-throughs, or YouTube research to understand everything, and even then when you're only reading the English Sub, there's a lot of nuance that is missing and can be explored to give this some themes of this game a deeper meaning.As someone who grew up in China watching Journey to the West, I am ecstatic about non-Chinese players experiencing the culture, listening to the instruments, and thinking about some of the themes in one of our classics.However, even though I'm so happy about this game from a cultural perspective, it is still a very solid game with run and rewarding game play (once you take the time to overcome the difficulty).So even without the cultural impact, I'd still recommend this game.",Recommended,1340,61.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

13829,"Honestly Game of the Year 2024. This is what Triple A gaming at 60$ should deliver! And I agree, this sends a big message to Budding Chinese Developers and Worldwide that Singleplayer games ARE PROFITABLE. With how prevalent Gacha Games and Online games are, Hopefully this is a wake up call to invest more into this instead of Gacha and the like.As for the challenge, since im no Dark Souls fan, im more of Different Difficult Game fan (mostly rhythm games) however, this is properly paced and balanced. There are times where camera and weird large AOE hitboxes are frustrating to deal with but the defensive options are very lenient. Havent encountered a boss that took me more than 10 tries to take out.Especially I want to share the Peak moment was (SPOILERS) when I fought the Heavenly Kings and the fight blurred between Cinematic and Gameplay and everything flowed so smoothly. It was an experience!A few nitpicks tho like getting from point A to point B is pretty slow. especially when chapter map sizes open up. The need for the Mount which is the Cloud should've been there early at least. Encountered a bug where a higher quality in Global Illumination, turns off sun shadows and lighting unless I pick it at low. I wish the lore bits in the journal are just descriptive of why and how the characters are what they are instead of some story snippets.",Recommended,1122,75.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

13837,"-What I liked: It's a beautiful game and the end of chapter cut scenes are enjoyable. Very fun and versatile combat system. The story is engaging and makes you want to learn the lore. The bosses are unique and challenging but fair and some make you want to try different builds and hone your skills. I really liked the way they make the game feel so much bigger by taking you from very guided and 'follow the path' areas to wide open spaces you can go almost anywhere in.-What I didn't like: I wish there were more of a parry dynamic, other than rock solid and perfect dodge. Something more like Sekiro. If you're a completionist, the luck farming for certain soaks, seeds and armor isn't the most fun time. While I can appreciate the wide openness of some areas, the constant invisible walls can be frustrating and take away from the experience. Finally, my biggest gripe is that we play as a monkey who cannot climb... (That's a joke, but still)Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a super fun, engaging and enjoyable experience. If you like boss rush, beat 'em up and RPG style game play then this is a game for you. I personally give this game an 8-8.5/10.",Recommended,945,86.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 13
13838,"Don't listen to IGN. This is an absolute MUST recommend!I'm very critical when it comes to games, yet I can't find anything I don't like with this game in particular. It's definitely my GOTY.There's no map - yes, but as long as you pay attention to the landmarks and your surroundings, you'd be able to find your way. And it does feel fun to explore around, enjoy the picturesque scenery, without a specific purpose in mind.There are invisible walls - yes, a nice way of telling you ""oops, you're heading in the wrong direction, try somewhere else"".Some tough boss fights - yes, it's an invitation to play around different builds. Switching up builds doesn't cost anything - its completely free.Souls-like - No. Maybe a bit, by having rat archers on rooftops, and sneaky others that jump out at you randomly. But otherwise, no.***May Contain Some Spoilers, Be Your Own Judge***The ending is beyond words, I can only say that I loved it.Some may say the final battle is too easy, but I see the opposite.It wasn't a battle.

Both of these combined gave enough depth to the game without it becoming a chore to remember all the available move-sets, which I greatly appreciate!I'm sure all who've played through the game could easily write an essay on it, but reviews should be kept short and I'm going to end mine here.If you are wondering about getting it...

13913,"This is a preliminary short review of this game about halfway through, 33 hours in.I think the game is amazing, some of the most fun I've had in gaming, but there are a couple setbacks that take this game down a notch. It could be a 10/10 but honestly its an elevated 9 - 9.5.If you're scared of Dark Souls games or soulslike. I implore you to put that fear aside and give this game a chance.Pros:+ The boss fights are absolute cinema in this game, I've enjoyed them so much. The astounding amount of patterns for each boss, their designs, its all pretty impeccable.+ The chapters and their respective flow is engaging+ Interesting story if lacking in a overarching development somewhat, but each chapter features their own story sort of.+ Graphics are gorgeous.+ Satisfying combat system and a plethora of transformations and skills to use, although this is where one of the biggest setbacks also reside.+ Beautiful OST+ Really engaging side quests and secrets.+ Rich enemy variety. Really impressed with the amount of unique monsters and bosses in each chapter.Cons:- The combat system could be so much better if Wukong had more moves and combos. A lot of the combat honestly does rely on you doing the same light attack combo to gather focus points, which you can then use to execute flashier and stronger moves.- Invisible Wall gallery and Map design: This is the second and probably biggest peeve for me in this game, the map design does seem to get better later on in my opinion, but early on it does seem sort of really amateurish. They could've masked the invisible walls much better. And in a lot of cases you could cut corners or jump off at your own risk, but the game doesn't let you.",Recommended,1397,49.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

13939,"Product received for freeBlooming proudly in the barren desert of AAA titles8.5/10For a long time, whenever talking about China's game industry, it seems that countless players have sighed and lamented. Though its market value is tremendous and cannot be underestimated, the entire industry is almost supported by online and mobile games, and there are few achievements in AAA single-player games. In this context, August 20, 2024, would definitely be an unforgettable day for Chinese gamers. The future of Chinese single-player games, Black Myth: Wukong, has officially been released. On its first day, it has already reached a stunning 2.2 million players, and as of today, its total sales have reached 18 million copies, not only did it set a new first-week sales record among its genre, but also became the single-player game with the highest peak player count on steam. As the Chinese saying goes, 'A big tree attracts the wind'. While Black Myth: Wukong has won a large number of fans, it has also faced widespread questions and criticism. Can the quality of this game live up to such outstanding sales and an incredible number of players?Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a work whose merits outweigh its flaws. Though its strengths and weaknesses are clear, we cannot dismiss it completely because of this. Games featuring traditional Chinese landscapes, realistic cultural scenes such as Buddha statues and temples, and Chinese Taoist Mythology are rare nowadays. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, this game showcases a level of visual refinement and scene interactivity that is beyond the reach of most previous AAA titles, the realistic and delicate scene interaction brings players an immersive gaming experience, and the stunning art is enough to allow players to indulge in this gorgeous world where every screenshot feels like wallpaper. Huge game worlds, rich game content, and a wide variety of enemies are ahead for players to explore, the game and combat in each chapter are unique and thrilling, the amazing music adds an immersive atmosphere to it, too. The movie-quality cutscenes are of extremely high standards in terms of camera movement and performance effects. The ending animations of each chapter, which are in different styles, are well-made and profound in connotation.Though the plot narrative technique is rather obscure and difficult to grasp, the in-game journal fully supplements the worldview, characters, and background in the form of fables or stories. Reading thoroughly will allow you to unravel the plot's complex themes. Countless talents and a wide range of spells for players to freely choose from, thus evolving into numerous genres of gameplay. The game's transformation mechanism is a major feature, combined with the character's flexible body movements and gorgeous battle performance effects, Black Myth: Wukong remains consistently entertaining and engaging in each battle. The final boss and the final hidden boss battles have put a lot of effort into the design of the mechanism, the battle scene, and the artistic conception conveyed. The upgradable that can freely reset and no death penalty have all greatly optimized the player's gaming experience, most players will not find the game overly difficult to complete.Whether in good or bad ways, this game draws heavily on the design of many souls-like games. Even though the plot of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely profound, the overly fragmented storytelling hinders player comprehension. The plot based on the conclusion of the Journey to the West, is very familiar to Chinese players, however, the lack of clear cause-and-effect explanations will likely confuse many others. The journal also contains a vast amount of text, not all players may have the patience to finish it, let alone delve into the original Journey to the West. While the Chinese voice acting is excellent, the English voice acting feels a little lackluster, and misplaced and missing subtitles also show that Black Myth: Wukong still needs to improve in terms of localization. The developer may aim to encourage players to get rid of guides and explore on their own, but in a vast world with interconnected routes, extremely low scene recognition, and high similarity, without route guides and in-game maps, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction when actually playing. The frequent appearance of invisible walls since the third chapter makes it even more difficult for players to judge the true boundaries of the map. Player would find it hard to experience the complete game content without a guide.The numerous skills and transformations vary significantly in strength, the character's fragile ability to withstand attacks also makes the game have relatively high requirements on the player's reaction ability and operational tolerance. The optimization of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely poor, with problems such as long loading time, frame drops, and crashes often occurring. In terms of the lighting transition between light and dark scenes, and the lighting effects in dark scenes, Black Myth: Wukong also performs extremely poorly. The design of the large bosses in the game, such as Captain wise-voice and The duskveil is problematic, the battle experience is frustrating. The design of the probability of dropping some collectibles is even worse, and compared to the earliest gameplay trailer, the officially released version has cut too much content. Even in the existing chapters, many story elements feel abrupt and lack depth, leaving too many gaps. Although the fifth and sixth chapters are also quite good, they are inferior to the previous chapters, and signs of development rush are extremely obvious.In a market lacking AAA titles, Game Science has made unremitting efforts and delivered Black Myth: Wukong in 4 years, which is no small feat. Whether through its unique, realistic, and excellent art, or its satisfying and exhilarating comfort, it will definitely make you indulge in it. If you take the time and savor it quietly, you will definitely be shocked and leave endless aftertaste. It should be noted that no matter how good a game is, it will eventually have its audience, and this is especially true for Black Myth: Wukong as an action role-playing game. As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing.' if you can accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you still need to experience it for yourself to understand its mystery.In the end, Black Myth: Wukong still benefits the vast majority of players on three major levels: in terms of game aesthetics, its success stands in stark contrast to the dismal ending of Concord, which implements political correctness and diversified aesthetics, and will inevitably sound the alarm for the art design of future games; in terms of the game engine, Black Myth: Wukong further demonstrates the massive potential of the Unreal 5 engine, more developers will likely turn to it for game development, which will surely bring games with more stunning visual effects and improved optimization in the future; in the Chinese game industry, the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong has overturned the previous monopoly of online games and mobile games in the market. The potential of single-player games will inevitably drive more Chinese developers to invest in it. Even if you discover that this game isn't to your liking, its popularity will surely bear fruit in the future and will be beneficial to the entire gaming industry.",Recommended,6271,74.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

13949,"Black Myth: Wukong is shaping up to be a truly remarkable game, blending stunning visuals with deep, engaging storytelling. The attention to detail in every aspect, from the breathtaking environments to the fluid character animations, is nothing short of extraordinary. The developers have beautifully captured the essence of classic Chinese mythology, bringing the legendary tale of the Monkey King to life with modern technology.The combat system feels smooth and dynamic, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience. Every battle is filled with strategy and excitement, allowing players to harness Wukong’s unique powers and abilities in innovative ways. The variety of enemies, each with distinct characteristics and styles, keeps every encounter fresh and immersive.What stands out the most is the sheer ambition of the game. It not only pushes the boundaries of what action RPGs can be, but it also serves as a love letter to the rich cultural history that inspired it.

It can work quite well as a possible sequel to the original Journey to the WestOverall graphics, design of characters and all aesthetics related material are actually quite good, I like it, even the low graphics setting is pretty solidThe gear, and the ability to get the mats are not too bad. If you take the time to explore. You will be able to mostly craft a decent amount of armor sets near end game. I think I was able to create at the very least 2 - 3 sets before NG.Combat is not too shabby either, with a but....will be in the ""What I don't like/prefer to see change""What I don't like/prefer to see change:One of the biggest things that I recognized almost immediately is the lack of a map, having a map would've been so helpful in exploring these huge maps and areas. Especially since each chapter is quite long.I personally would've preferred that leveling increased your attack and defense, maybe not every level but maybe every other level or two at the least. Some bosses just do so much damage. And if your someone like me that has a bit of a slow brain and takes time to adjust to these attack timings, it would've really helped alot.Now for the combat, I think that for the most part like mentioned above its not bad. You have light attacks, dodging, heavy attacks and the usual. But what I experienced at least is, sometimes the game will not respond to some of my commands and I will have pressed that hotkey...exaggerating....like a bazillion times. Like space bar for dodge. And there were some bosses were my lock on would randomly disappear on its own. Not for when bosses fly high in the sky or something. Like it would be when its just regular combat near/on the ground. Whether this is a bug or my PC I don't know. But this is what I am experiencing.",Recommended,1492,50.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

13989,"I waited until I 100% achievements'd this game until I was going to write my review. I wanted to make sure I experienced everything this game has to offer to give it a fair review. I just finished that 5 mins ago.9.5/10(I'll keep this as spoiler free as I can)Pros: First off, I love this game. The dialogue is so great and well voice acted for both chinese and english. The story was really epic feeling and really pulled me in. It consumed me for the entire time I played it, And i wont lie, it was hard, and thats coming from someone who beat all the souls games moderately easily. It really forces you to learn all the abilities and adapt your strategy for some of the harder bosses. It also teaches you to be be aggressive and learn patterns to dodge. There's a ton of exploration, and secrets are kind of different in this game but very thematic and I honestly loved it. Combat just felt so fun and like I said it was hard, but importantly it was fair. I didn't feel like my deaths were not deserved from me getting hit. The gravity of the difference between the endings hit me so hard.Cons: The invisible walls. So many invisible walls. I can see the terrain and there are a ton of nooks and crannies that I want great lengths to explore but there was just nothing. Needing basically all of the items to get 100%, it means you need to farm RNG items that have an insane run to for the nearest farmable one of them, and on top of that, a very slim chance to get. A couple times I can understand but it was for sooooo many items. It became a slog and felt forced. It brought nothing to the game and made me a little hate the beautiful surroundings I kept seeing over and over and over.Despite the couple of bad things, I cannot overstate how much I loved this game. Fighting bosses that were tough and finally beating them was additive, and it was also nice to learn the story of Wukong and Journey to the West, which got me to look up the story and explanations outside of the game because I was so interested.tl:dr Fantastic game and I think my game of the year for sure!",Recommended,1683,94.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

However, the game has its own flaws.The map design can feels a bit underwhelming, i'm fine with invisible wall blocking the paths, but the thing that annoyed me the most are the lack of exploration rewards.

I could not recommend this game enough it is a MUST PLAY!",Recommended,547,62.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 13
14039,"After 55 hours of gameplay and completing the 1st play-through with unlocked true ending, I’m left with a profound sense of satisfaction. The game's stunning visuals blew me away, and the heart-touching music left me deeply moved. However, there were moments of frustration, particularly with some map designs, and a few plot threads that didn’t quite reach a top-tie game conclusion. But when I completed my play-through, It make me feel the happy days of childhood. it was a moment of pure contentment.VisualsTop-tier Art Direction: The game captures the essence of nature’s beauty, translating the poetic descriptions of vast forests and misty mountains into breathtaking in-game landscapes. What I once thought was a joke—""you can’t tell virtual from reality""—has become my reality. The female characters are stunning to the point where I had to actively stop myself from gawking. All the political correctness in the world can roll away for all I care.Meticulous Attention to Detail: The game spares no expense in filling its world with detail. Every temple, statue, and stone marker is crafted with care. Even the sheer number of enemies, over 170 including bosses and regular foes, rarely feel repetitive, each with unique designs and styles.Interactive Visual Effects: Battle effects are a sight to behold. For instance, fighting a specific boss on water creates different ripple patterns depending on the weapon movements, and in one memorable fight, scattered book pages seem to dance in rhythm with the combat.Combat Cinematics: Battles such as the “Formidable God” or the fight against a decaying warrior push the game’s cinematic boundaries to new heights. These fights not only look fantastic but are filled with little Easter eggs—stealing gourds, munching on peaches, and much more. The epic fight with the fire god on Flame Mountain feels like stepping into a living ink painting, a dazzling display of traditional aesthetics meeting modern gameplay.MusicNorthern Shaanxi Folk Ballads: One of the most unexpected yet perfectly fitting music choices. The traditional folk style merges seamlessly with the game’s atmosphere and enhances the storytelling in a way that's both novel and authentic.Battle Themes: Each boss has its own memorable battle music that dynamically changes depending on the stage of the fight. One example is the multi-phase BGM of the Yellow Wind Demon, which intensifies as the battle progresses. Each transformation, including the protagonist’s, has its own unique background score filled with traditional Chinese music elements.Combat SystemDrawing Inspiration from the Best: The combat system borrows heavily from great action games. You have stance switching, spirit collection, counters, evasion, and seamless combo chaining. What sets it apart is how these elements are tied into the lore. Monster abilities, transformations, and spiritual techniques align with the protagonist’s 72 transformations, making the game feel rooted in its mythos.Flexible Builds: Though the base combat system feels a bit unrefined, the extensive variety of spells, potions, and equipment attributes provide deep build diversity. With zero-cost respec options, you’re free to experiment with different setups, making it very player-friendly.Cursed Treasures: Side quests reward you with relics that can drastically alter the difficulty of boss fights. A brilliant design choice that not only aligns with the lore but also adds variety to combat strategies.Narrative – A Tale UnfinishedStrong Opening: The first three chapters are a masterclass in adaptation, with a full narrative arc that even newcomers to the story can appreciate. The ending animations and scroll paintings are a wonderful addition to the storytelling.Rushed Ending: Unfortunately, the last few chapters feel unfinished. Major plot points like the downfall of certain characters and entire races are hinted at but never fully explored. The influence of certain literary works is apparent, but some storylines left me wanting more, especially with the creators teasing adherence to the original narrative in interviews.Level DesignInvisible Walls: A common issue in games, but here the invisible walls felt especially jarring. Early levels condition you to expect them, but later stages break this rule, leading to some confusion. Some cliffs hide secret areas, while others are blocked, and it’s hard to tell which is which.Landmark Confusion: The map is large and beautiful, but its realism sometimes works against it. Without clear landmarks, many players (myself included) struggled to navigate. The lack of distinguishing features makes it difficult to remember key locations.Counterintuitive Paths: Normally, game designers highlight the main path with bright lights or other markers. Here, some critical paths are hidden in the shadows, leading to frustrating moments where the most obvious route turns out to be a dead end.Combat IssuesLock-On and Camera: The game’s camera system struggles when fighting large or airborne bosses. For instance, in a fight with a sky-bound dragon, the lock-on feature makes it difficult to track incoming attacks properly, leading to unfair deaths.Collision Detection: Certain bosses have inconsistent hitboxes. It’s frustrating to land a heavy attack on a boss’s limb only for it to miss entirely due to mismatched hitboxes.Final ThoughtsThis game offers an unparalleled visual and auditory experience. Its world feels alive, rich with detail, and the combat system has the potential to be great with some refinement. The story, while unfinished, is packed with emotional highs. However, the unpolished combat mechanics and occasional missteps in level design prevent it from achieving true greatness. Despite these flaws, it still stands as an ambitious and bold leap forward for the Chinese game industry. Like the early steps of Demon’s Souls or The Witcher 1, this game feels like the beginning of something much bigger.Is it fun? Absolutely. Even without the ""chinese filter,"" I can confidently say the game is worth playing. The journey is just as important as the destination.Purchase RecommendationI highly recommend this game to most players. Even at full price, it’s worth the investment. However, if you have an underpowered PC, struggle with fast-paced action games, this might not be for you.",Recommended,5376,55.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

14053,"As of 9/12/2024, 20+ hours of gameplay on steam and 70+ on my PS5, Black Myth: Wukong has 342% delivered upon its promises and then some. This game has essentially everything i love in a video game all compiled into a single, beautiful, VASTLY entertaining, thrilling, and even mysterious experience that i haven't felt in almost a decade of gaming. The game is NOT souls-like as folks tend to keep saying, its more Souls-Inspired how i see it. It takes elements from souls games, but then becomes its own beast entirely, in the best possible way. The world of Black Myth, despite not being AS open as Elden Ring (via the invisible walls), has many and i mean MANY pathways and secret locations with missable content if you aren't careful. The NPC's are entertaining to interact with (my absolute favorites being the residents of the ruyi scroll), the bosses just bleed and ooze uniqueness and diversity, not one boss is similar to the other in how they fight, and each boss ranges from being easy but fun, to challenging, to straight-up monsters (literally and metaphorically). The cinematic cutscenes are just *french kiss* supernaturally stunning. And though this may just be personal bias, but a game revolving around the chinese monkey king Sun Wukong, and bringing him back into the spotlight in a big way just makes me so damn happy. The game may not appeal to everyone with specific expectations, but I believe the Overwhelmingly positive feedback the game has received since its launch speaks for itself. The game knows what it is, and delivers tremendously. I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong enough.",Recommended,1341,26.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

14059,"Great game overall.Does have some really weird difficulty balance issues. You'll go from a nearly impossible boss as one of the first bosses in the game, to breezing through every boss effortlessly for a few hours, then suddenly run into a boss that just annihilates you every time and takes 15 tries to beat. To another 5 hours of pathetically easy bosses, to several very hard ones, to then fight the final boss in the game and beat all 4 phases of his fight in the very first try.Now I'm very good at games in general, but I don't have much experience with ""Dark Souls"" games, I've only played one of them before so my take on this will be more of a ""normal"" gamer's take on it. I found the fights to be generally overall easy, with the occasional insanely hard boss fight tossed in that reminded me of dark souls.The game itself is however, just plain good old fun.

14089,"Reviewing this game is tough because, at its core, it's a solid title. The graphics are impressive, with intriguing character designs, and the bosses provide a satisfying challenge. Combat feels responsive and engaging.So, why the thumbs down? In a word: Elden Ring. After experiencing a game like that, jumping into this one feels like a step down. While the combat is enjoyable, it becomes repetitive over time. You're given spells, transformations, and stances, but eventually, it all boils down to repeating the same light combos. The lack of a blocking mechanic, while an interesting choice, further limits combat options, making it feel even more monotonous.Exploration is another area where the game falls short. It presents the illusion of vast areas to explore, but in reality, all paths lead to the same destination. There are some nice Easter eggs scattered throughout, but again, I can't help but feel that Elden Ring has set the bar too high.I don’t want to be overly critical because this is a genuinely good game—a potential Game of the Year contender, even. But it's just not for me. My biggest issue is that I can't stop comparing it to a far superior game, which is what drew me to this one in the first place.If I had bought this on sale, my opinion might be more positive.

At the end of each chapter a wonderful animation with a profound message will be presented to you followed by a painting representing the chapter that you just finished.

However this game feels no where near as hard as any kind of souls game. The combat is extremely fun and i would personally say forgiving. I am on chapter 3 currently at level 30 and am absolutely loving it. In reviews people say its extremely difficult but if you play aggressive/strategical there isn't much too it ! The game is also stunning and runs very well. I would love to see steam deck support as seems possible as can maintain 50 fps on mine so if some kind of option was set in place to optimise it for steam deck it would be cherry on top. I would personally say for me this game is extremely fun and the bosses have an exhilarating feel to them but hasn't given me the same achievement level as Elden Ring bosses on your first run !I also feel like £50 is quite high but is extremely fair for the amount of detail in which has gone into the game.BUT THIS SHOULD BE HOW AAA TITLES SHOULD BE !",Recommended,872,40.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

14150,"Story: 8/10The storytelling in this game along with it's sidequests feel like the main draw for the game IMO. Paired together with the artwork in some cutscenes, it's a very pretty story despite how short the game can be. However, I do strongly feel like the ""secrets"" in the game did not have to be separated from the main story. Secrets in terms of story should be more like genuine easter eggs or a full on secret ending, not cropped out parts of the main story to discover later; at least, not in this game's design.Gameplay: 6-7/10The gameplay is VERY fun generally. However alot of the enemy designs take away from the fun of it occasionally. While it is very pleasing to see some bosses have special interactions when spells do not affect them, some bosses feel like the gimmick behind their design makes dealing with them more frustrating than fun. Given how many tools you have, it's easy to understand that you can outright destroy some bosses without even seeing some attacks, but the cases where the bosses can somewhat survive such things are either very few in number or the boss in question has a design that is unexpectedly more frustrating than it had to be. Speaking for the enemies themselves, there's a particular secret boss at the end of the game that is designed almost too well that it makes me wonder why wasn't used for normal enemies. Moving away from bosses, the camera in this game is significantly way worse than usual for games of this nature. The camera has an extremely hard time tracking flying targets and sometimes the camera doesn't even follow the enemy itself, but more like the ground under the target. Perfect dodges are a very popular feature lately, however this game suffers from having them while making you unsure of how outcomes will be due to the restrictions on dodging. A common example would be like: You perfect dodge the first hit of an attack string, you can choose to dodge the second hit, but before you land right where the third hit will land before you can take any action. Whereas an easier solution to this common scenario can be perfect dodging the first hit, and doing absolutely nothing while the second hit completely misses you due to having extra iframes, then dodging the 3rd hit however you like. There are a couple bosses here and there that leave that dilemma and while there are clearly several ways to deal with that problem, it's not quite a nice state of mind to feel like you've been punished for doing something seemingly right. Going back to secrets in the game: I'm immediately going to assume that certain bosses were designed with Zelda in mind. **Spoiler**: Finally, by the time you reach the latter half of the game, it feels like the game's flow goes all over the place. This is somewhat related to the spoiler before, but the game's difficulty, map progression, and a couple other features seem to be thrown into the game for the same of either wow factor or rogue inspiration from other games. While the potential inspirations from other games is very cool here and there, it's a bit all over the place sometimes. Overall, the gameplay is fun with some grievances here and there.Length: 6/10While the length of the game is okay, I was really hoping that the game would have more reason to replay it other than simply having a NG+ with buffed bosses. The game has some very creative features on some bosses and it would've been really cool to see bosses suddenly have new moves or something of the sort, but replaying the game seems more like an excuse to grind out stats (along with a particular unlock way later that seems lacking in impact by the time you get it). Due to the short length of the game, I do feel the price of the game doesn't quite suit the standards especially when considering below.PC Compatability: 5/10After seeing the credits, it's clear that there wasn't THAT big of a testing team for the game. So while there can be some praise for the fact that this game looks as it is: the game really does not run very well in certain parts of the game. Turning all the settings low even seems like it causes more issues than having them higher while playing. Even for some particular areas, it feels like the game was designed to be ""forced"" to be pretty over being playable that the game can even come off as frustrating just from the questionable optimization alone. Lastly, this is somewhat related to gameplay: but due to the occasionally unstable graphics or fps on certain aspects of the game, it leaves a strong feeling of confusion when taking damage from some bosses. I've noticed some bosses actually do slow down the game intentionally when certain attacks are used, obviously theres some slowdown effects when a perfect dodge occasions, but sometimes there's a hint of distrust of whether I've taken damage from player error or the game lagged for a moment when mixing in the previous factors.Overall: 7/10The game is nice, it's worth playing. Optimizations for the game would be VERY welcome to make the game way more enjoyable. But I highly do not recommend the game if you are not someone who enjoys exploring every area. If you were just going to play the game solely to finish it as fast as possible, this game might become more frustrating than enjoyable.",Recommended,4344,44.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

They don't have picking back up soul once you die or the high difficulty level that soul games provide. The mob layout is very normal with no traps or jump scare.

But why can't I use all spells and transformations? Now a solid 7/10.I think I missed a meditation spot. I need to Google it. WHAT? I missed the boss and a quest? WHAT?! There is a secret fight on top of the turtle. Ok ok. I'll just enter Chapter 4. And where can I find the Golden Thread? What!!! There was a secret wall I needed to destroy in Chapter 2! Ok ok. Wait... Chapter 1. I did everything in Chapte... Boss BEHIND THE WATERFALL?!?!?!?? AND ANOTHER ONE BEHIND THE SANDS IN CHAPTER 2!!! AAAAAA it had cutscenes and fights were so good. Okay, I also found those purple magic circles in prison. How will I unlock them?... Of course I missed another boss, transformation, weapon, dialog, and friend. Okay, okay. I think I got it all. Did you just give me a map where all my friends are? 🌱🐃 Ooo, you can have your own garden here. That's nice. It's an amazing game despite the flaws I mentioned. Honestly, I like that it's linear. It would be nice if we could traverse across the map faster, but all those amazing things make it so insignificant that I don't care anymore. In Devil May Cry 5, after a few seconds of running, characters start to run or even slide on their magic faster through levels. And those linear walls don't bother me anymore.Scorpion Lord boss 10/10. Yellow Loong boss 10/10 tears. The whole secret location in Chapter 4 has autumn vibes.

14179,"Beautiful game, visuals, and interesting story telling. The combat however is fundamentally flawed. Perfect dodges still lead to taking damage due to no iframes, many bosses have erratic attack patterns that prevent you from consistently perform your combo. This goes hand in hand with the flawed skill system where half the trees (or even the whole pillar staff stances) are not useful in any of the boss fights. In the end you are left with three moves, light attack, heavy attack, and combining them in a varied/ evading combo...and to execute them you sometimes rely on your immobilize spell. And if it is on cooldown you are just dodging until it is available again.",Not Recommended,558,20.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

14188,"It's absolutley amazing...if you like well fleshed out story based adventure RPG games that actually have passion poured into them for the past 4 years. In other words, its probably the best game of 2024 by a lot. Also, it's not a souls-like, here's why... 1, it's not really all that hard, rather it's hard enough to keep you invested, which is good. 2, your level and skill points are seperate, not the same. 3, just because it has health flask esc. items and dodge rolls doesn't make it a souls-like, Metal Gear Rising Revengance has dodge rolls and limited heals but it's far from a souls-like (also another fantastic game btw). 4, it's literally just a boss rush meaning you can pretty much completely ignore all other enemies and there's boss after boss after boss, wheras souls-likes have almost as much focus on regular enemies as the bosses, yes you can pass them up too but not if you get into farming which is tedious and grindy which brings me to my next point, 5, BMWK has grindy bits to it, but you, for the most part, will level accordingly as the game progresses, where, with souls-likes, everything is a grind, if you cant beat a boss effeciently, grind, if you cant wear this piece of armor, grind, if you can't wield this weapon, grind. 6, the simple presence of varied combos with light and heavy attacks and special heavy attacks (depending on the stance) is far different from the usual...put on these buffs, drinks these potions, eat these special foods and cast these spells and then you can fight with basic light or heavy attacks and dodge accordingly, i mean yes you still have to dodge accordingly in BMWK, but the game gives you so much leaniency with perfect dodges, skill tree skills that help dodging, potions that help dodging, and even the relics that can help with dodging too, so in other words, the game pretty much gives you every thing you need to beat the game no problem with only minor difficulty and more so to just enjoy the game and what it has to offer in terms of story and gameplay, instead of souls-likes making you want to bash your head against a wall because you cant beat a regular boss. ( i beat elden ring btw +DLC twice) so im not just complaining because i'm not good enough to play elden ring or games like it, i'm just saying that BMWK is better because its not a souls-like, rather it's a more refined, more fleshed out GOW clone more than anything.

14210,"There are many issues with the game that have already been talked about, such as performance or invisible walls, but I want to focus on boss design as there are so many flaws in this game.You will often encounter bosses specifically designed to punish the player for simply playing under established rules. Immobilize is a spell you are granted early on that is meant to freeze people for a short duration. Sometimes, a boss can be frozen like usual, and other times, that same boss will instantly break your immobilized spell, going against established rules. Some bosses have attacks specifically meant to counter your move-specific counter. A boss named Yellow Long will instantly parry your ""see-through"" move because he is programmed never to be hit by it. It does not matter if you have a window or executed the move perfectly; it will never land because the game was programmed to punish you for using it. The final boss in chapter 4 will sometimes parry your light attack combo instantly, even if he is in the middle of a different animation, because he is programmed to punish you regardless of his current actions. Let's not even mention how some bosses have absurd health pools that require hacking away at them non-stop for 10 minutes just to get them remotely close to low health. Additionally, so many bosses are programmed to run away from you and create distance, forcing you to end your combo and chase after them. Some bosses will vanish and break your lock-on while you run aimlessly around the arena before they attack you from a random direction or the sky. Other bosses have attacks that are so quick in succession that even though you time your dodges well, you will inevitably be hit by one of their attacks in the chain because your dodge simply isn't fast enough to dodge them all. And don't even get me started on some sequences of scripted damage that is entirely unavoidable.This boils down to lousy boss design in many areas. There are so many instances where the game does away with ""difficult but fair"" in favor of ""difficult and BS."" The game has potential, but all the hype around ""GOTY"" is misplaced.",Not Recommended,1764,26.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

Its a mainly melee combat along with spells, potions, etc.It has shrines (bonfires) where you rest, heal, level up, repair and respawn trash mobs.its a linear game world full of trash mobs, mini bosses and main bosses.Its not a unfair game but can be challenging at times.Main difference from a ""true soulsborne"" game would be that there is no blocking, parry or riposte. And the selection of wepons is limited to staffs. There are no axes, swords or scythes but that is necessarily not a bad thing but it definitely limit different play styles.

14277,"I've beaten the game twice, and have 100%'ed it just yesterday, so my opinions are still fresh.This game is weird for me, it's great, you can tell how much love and passion was put into this game, arguably one of the most passionate games I've ever played, there's a lot of minute detail in the lore, story, characters, secret dialogue, and secrets. Alas, despite all of that, it feels like a game that struggles with it's identity.It tries to be a souls-like with it's core mechanics, has DMC-like style switching, yet it doesn't excel at either; the souls mechanics are out of the window since it only really borrows perfect dodging and parrying (which in this case, it's pretty much like Sekiro), stamina doesn't really matter because you get an absurd amount of recovery and bar, that it doesn't matter 95% of the time, unlike the souls games having stamina management part of the core gameplay. It tries to have style switching like DMC, but the skill tree for those 3 styles you get in the game are disappointingly not that complex, it basically just unlocks 1 extra move for each stance, and the rest of the skills for that specific stance is basically just things like making it hit harder, launch charged attacks faster, or do something niche like drinking your gourd on a staff or doing a light attack finisher with less than 1 focus. Due to the lack of actual combos and it mostly just being a spam spells and attack button game, I didn't feel as captivated.The bosses are great, albeit most of them I beat without feeling the satisfaction of learning them properly and finally beating them like in the souls games, specifically Elden Ring and Lies of P have really difficult, amazing bosses that force you to learn them properly to succeed, where-as in this game you get so many easy to access tools to deal damage that you can face-tank a lot of bosses, not to mention most bosses don't have many moves to learn, it's like fighting a dark souls 2 boss.Of course, not all bosses are easy or just a plot obstacle, I was very impressed by Yellow Loong, the final boss and secret final bosses of the game, they were all amazing and noteworthy, I sincerely hope if they do release a DLC they make more bosses that rely more on your combat skills and understanding of the mechanics rather than face-tanking and spamming spells to win.The OST is great, it's nothing to write home about, but it's not amazing either, it felt a bit too cinema-y for me to enjoy it, like it was written and composed for the main purpose of it being a first time experience type of OST, there's a few outliers of course. I enjoyed the Shangxi headless Buddha singing a ton! It gave chapter 2 a very ethereal and awesome feel that I cannot describe, and I wish more songs were like that, but it is what it is.As for the story; as someone who isn't all that familiar with Journey to the West, it felt incredibly lacking. It's a heavily story focused game, and it assumes you have preconceived notions and knowledge regarding the story, which in turns makes it much harder for someone like me (and many people too, who don't know much about the novel) to feel left out and confused the majority of the time. The journal doesn't help that much either because it's just 10 paragraphs of reading that *also* assumes you know what a lot of chinese terms mean. The God of War and Hades franchises are based on mythology and delve extremely deep into it, but they are able to teach someone who is not at all familiar with their lore a ton of history, unlike Black Myth Wukong. I also wish the Destined One (player character) talked, it's a game that has just as much story, lore, characters just as there is combat, when Sun Wukong talked in chapter 5 in the music video, it was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cool, because he seems like such a complex character, and then you have us, the player character... We have no personality, no clear goals besides the one we are told to do, no inner conflicts, no anything at all. The crumbs I got with the face expressions I got I appreciated, but it's such an incredibly missed opportunity to just make us this mute, random monkey that doesn't do literally anything for himself. If we talked like Sun Wukong or Bajie the story would've been elevated 10x more.Off-topic, the developers are also weird. They are incredibly misogynistic in their statements and it also shows in the game where the women are always degraded or used to hit on them (specifically Bajie that keeps doing that, it's annoying as ♥♥♥♥, takes away from his character at the end of chapter 4 when you realize he's just been a misogynistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 3 chapters straight). Because of that, this game unfortunately didn't land with me as it should have, I always had a sour taste of my mouth when playing it, but it's still a great game to come out of China, and I hope they improve on a lot of things.TL;DR Combat is okay, not amazing. Story is very confusing for non-readers. OST is great. Bosses are very fun regardless of difficulty or rather lack-thereof. Secrets and exploration is amazing. 7/10 game",Recommended,4169,57.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

The game gives you a sense of freedom in the combat, but then randomly renders your skills ineffective against different bosses and thus forces you into some specific combat mechanic, Most annoying are the scripted ""cut scenes"" during late boss fights that are ALWAYS played as a reaction on your combat inputs. It works in a game that focuses on cinematic experience, but not in a game where combat mechanics should play important role.Graphics and the world is nice, but exploration is frustrating when you run into a invisible wall all the time.

Chapter 6 felt like a slog, half-baked chapter which could render the whole experience unpleasant; a bad aftertaste on the ending note I would say. However, the last 2 fights for the ending at least redeemed the bad experience of chapter 6 for me.Overall a great pickup to this semi action and semi boss rush title. 100% recommend everyone to get it.Will it win GOTY? not sure but I sure hope it does.

I haven’t felt the want to finish a game that badly in a long time; and do as many of the achievements and things I can along the way.The combat feels great once you understand how to use the different stances together, along with spells and spirits. The story is amazing, and makes me want to watch the 1986 show and listen to the audiobook to really understand everything.That being said, Chapter 6, and one other boss in Chapter 4 are not great. , along with the first and the final bosses of the Chapter 6, just feel very unfun. There’s a lot of flying and moving and the game takes what you’ve learned through the entire game and throws it all away and even punishes you for it.Along with that, Chapter 6 feels very unfleshed and is the first instance where you see copy/paste bosses (because they are literally the same), granted they are mini bosses.In any case, I still loved this game and my time with it. I plan on going through and doing at least NG+, as there are a couple missables and I don’t think I’m that tired of the game just yet.I’d rate this a solid 8.5 or 9 out of 10 for me. Incredible, fantastic, fair (except for a few instances), thrilling, and length feels great. I am excited for a future DLC!",Recommended,1014,77.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

14478,"""Black Myth: Wukong is a soul-stirring game masterpiece. It reshapes the familiar and mysterious world of Journey to the West with its unique oriental aesthetics. Every frame is a visual feast. The interweaving of light and shadow, the perfect fusion of classical charm and modern technology, makes people feel as if they have traveled through time and space and experienced the unfinished heroic epic.Wukong is given a new soul and depth here. He is no longer simply rebellious and unruly, but carries a heavy mission and choice. The plot of the game is gripping and confusing, allowing people to go deeper and deeper in the puzzle solving and exploration, uncovering dusty secrets one by one. The ultimate coordination of music and sound effects pushes the game atmosphere to a climax. Every jump of a note seems to touch the deepest resonance of the soul.Black Myth: Wukong is not just a game, it is a cultural inheritance and innovation, a brave exploration of the boundaries of game quality, and it allows us to see the infinite possibilities of games. This is a work that all players should calm down and savor carefully, and it deserves all the praise and praise!""",Recommended,973,47.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

It's frustrating because the little I was able to play felt amazing, and I can tell that this game has huge potential.I'm sure future patches might fix these issues, but as of now, my experience was too unstable to enjoy. I’ll definitely keep an eye on future updates and might give it another try when the game’s stability improves.

Learn to pace the attacks instead of button mashing and time dash well, anyone can defeat bosses with little to no damage taken, it just takes patience and practice.The hit feedback is 120% on point, like you can almost feel your attacks landing on the targets, which is a huge point for me. And of course, I think we're all sick and tired of the same old Medieval/Greek Mythology/Zombie/Military style games from Western studios that often use reskined characters/monsters and animations with clunky combat. This game is not only refreshing, but based on an ancient Chinese Mythology with incredibly fascinating lore that was made with upmost passion.

The combat system has so many mechanics to make fights dynamic and interesting. It never lets up in its long play time. Easily one of the best games of the year.

The wait has been long, but now it's here.And it's AMAZING!!!The visuals, the soundtrack, the boss and the lore are so amazing that on my own free time I decide to seek more info on the chiness mythology and Wukong himself! the gameplay is a match between God of War 2018 and Dark souls 3 the game is relativly open (not on the same sense as Elden ring but more likely like Dark souls 3) and you play has a badass character that can do a lot of tricks.You can sense that the devs put all of their talents and loves into this game (some games clearly lack that aspect)The gameplay is 9.5/10 (there is some questionables hitboxs on some bosses), the musics is 10/10, the story 10/10 the visuals 10/10 and most importantly it is fun.Game of the year in my opinion",Recommended,697,74.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

14773,"I recently had the pleasure of diving into ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" and I must say, it stands out as a breath of fresh air in the souls-like genre. While many games in this space are known for their punishing difficulty, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" offers a more casual experience that still retains thrilling combat and exploration.The gameplay feels fluid and accessible, allowing me to fully enjoy the stunning visuals and intricate world design without being stuck in a loop of frustration. The combat mechanics are engaging, with a variety of moves and combos that make each encounter feel unique.What truly sets ""Black Myth: Wukong"" apart is its captivating storytelling and rich cultural references, drawing from the classic tale of the Monkey King. The game beautifully integrates myth with action, resulting in an experience that’s both entertaining and thought-provoking.Overall, if you’re a fan of souls-like games but prefer a more casual approach, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a must-play. The blend of accessibility and depth makes it not just a worthy competitor, but in my opinion, an even better experience than other souls games. Highly recommend it!8.5/10",Recommended,976,50.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 12
14774,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning action-RPG rooted in Chinese mythology. Instead of being open-world, it offers a more focused, linear experience, which allows for richly detailed environments and handcrafted encounters.

However, it also channels the fast-paced, flashy combat of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, blending tactical depth with high-energy action.The story, based on Journey to the West, is deeply tied to Chinese mythology, making the adventure feel epic and culturally rich. With its breathtaking visuals, engaging combat, and mythological narrative, Black Myth: Wukong is shaping up to be an exciting and unique experience.",Recommended,656,130.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

14789,"Steam Deck Playability ( 7/10)GOTF ? (100/10) !!DLSS MOD USESteam Deck LCD ReviewSo, after extensive research on trying to play this game without too much an issue. Playing it with so called DLSS MOD is VERY RECOMMENDED. Seeing many people saying about how this will struggle in Chapter 2 on forth especially on tiger vanguard and other bosses. I would say, this game can run perfectly by using the mod I mention above.Chapter 1 PreviewStarting from the prologue, i have a bit of problem with the graphics but that all changed after the Prologue. Graphics from Steam Deck is as people know is ALL Set to LOW. However, i set Texture to HIGH because i still can run it great without impacting the performance by a lot. Take in mind, i am using the DLSS MOD. Therefore the Frame Generation is on. In my Steam Settings also i enable Allow Tearing, and Manual GPU Clock set to 1600 MHz with Scaling Filter FSR set to 3 Sharpness. I experiment a lot with this and doing as above, i actually got very good looking graphics with acceptable performance, getting almost 60 fps stable except sometime it might drop to 55-59 or lower depend on the location. However my play in Chapter 1 is almost perfect and i like it very much.Starting from Chapter 2 Above, I set Texture back to low, because there is pixelated environment and stuttering keep happening. However, i manage to run it stable in 60 fps so it worth the sacrifice. There is still stuttering sometime but i guess this is because loading the environment and so on. My fight with all the bosses does not affect anything much. No lagging input like people mention which is weird. Probably just me, but i am glad everything went smooth .To put it simply, running DLSS MOD imo is just important if you want to try play in Steam Deck. Take note i also run CryoUtilities and also Wukong with Latest Proton GE-11. This is also been done in Steam Deck LCD. So i dont see how OLED cant run better than this unless you do something wrong. I hope there is optimization been done to make it much better and no need of DLSS MOD.My Steam Deck Settings:Frame Limit 60 FPSAllow TearingManual GPU Clock 1600MHzScaling Filter FSR ( Sharpness 3)Game Resolution ( Set in Properties ) = 1280x720 If you use DLSS MOD , Perhaps using lower can improve the performance ( Need testing) []IN-Game SettingsPrefer All Low, OFF everything OFF like V-Sync and Motion Blur for Smooth gameplay. Can make Exception for Texture to set to HIGH depend if you can run it much better or want to sacrfice some performance. Prefer to set to low in Chapter 2 above because just how big the environment is.From my gameplay and research , WUKONG IS ONE OF A MUST HAVE for HandHeld Console . Of course there is many room for improvement which i hope the dev consider to do so for Steam Deck. I have not being sleeping playing this game for a day and looking for the best way to experience on Steam Deck. For those who have problem with this game being unplayable, try to get the DLSS MOD like i mention and try to do more research just like what i did.

As if that wasn't enough, a rather striking individual with three eyes continued to deal me the same fate time and again.

14798,"I am on my fifth playthrough now and I cannot stop playing it lol.Ever since Sekiro, I have been looking for a game that is challenging with satisfying combat experiences. Elden Ring was fun but the combat is just not as interactive and satisfying as Sekiro. And now with Black Myth: Wukong, I have finally found another game that gives such satisfying combat experiences. I would even say this game actually excels Sekiro in some aspects. I love how fast-paced the combats are, and being aggressive is actually beneficial just like Sekiro. In addition, the fact there are so many spells, spirits, transformations, stances, equipment skills available adds variety to the combat experiences. There are so many different playstyle or build to choose from and you can change your build any time. Even at my fifth playthrough, I am still discovering new ways to play the game. My favorite thing to do is to switch stances mid-battle and see-through counter with different varied combos (so satisfying when pulling it off). On top of the move variety, no two bosses are the same and every fight is just incredibly cinematic.For people looking to start souls-like games, I would recommend starting with this one. This game is much more forgiving and easy to get into compared to actual souls games. You don't lose anything on death, you can refund and respec skill points any time you want, you have a much stronger dodge that enables dodging at last second before you get hit, and you can farm levels if you are having trouble with a boss. Besides being lenient, the game is also just very polished in every aspect. It definitely lives up to its ""overwhelmingly positive"" reputation.",Recommended,1393,82.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 12
14799,"I'm really surprised with how good this game turned out to be. For about 40 hours, Wukong is an action game that plays like Dark Souls/Souls-likes & God of War 2018, and its got great combat & game mechanics that were really enjoyable! The story was hard to understand for most of the game but it didn't derail the fun (I don't know Chinese mythology at all). Being able to change your stats & perk points on the go was a plus, and the exploration was very rewarding, as it leads to secret areas, bosses, items that give you advantages further on, etc. Easy game of the year pick as of now for 2024. 10/10",Recommended,491,47.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

Where it feels like open world but its kinda still low key dungeon type. And the way it really makes you Rage after losing to a boss after 69+ Tries is very Elden Ring/Dark Souls/Armored Core 6 type.With how Difficult some of the bosses are. I am surprised that it has 598k+ Positive reviews!On AC6, they had to nerf bosses because they were too hard!And yes its a very good game, and the Graphics are next level.I think what's missing mainly is a Map which can be annoying at times when you are trying to explore the areas.

I bought a new gaming desktop for this game and started this game the day after it released. It took me a while to finish this game since I working full time and I also stuck at couple bosses. Overall, the true ending boss fight was mind-blowing and I actually enjoyed this game a lot. Definitely recommend this game. This game has a variety of mini bosses and bosses which brings a lot of fun to explore and enjoy. The first 4 chapters are amazing but the last chapter is a bit lame in comparison. I got a bit bored looking for bosses. However, it is still a very well polished game that shows the Chinese culture and Journal to the West, As a Chinese-Canadian player that I'm very happy to see this game receives a lots of attention and sells well. Looking forward for the DLCs and Game Science's next game.作为一位华人玩家真的很高兴这游戏做得这么出息。一直忍着不要评论知道双结局都打出。但整体真的非常出息，令人感叹大陆的第一个AAA游戏完成度这么高真的很令人惊喜。虽然作为手残党都卡在某些boss颇久。 尤其是打完小黄龙之后没有拔武器而没拿到龙变身令我差不多快哭了，毕竟打了最久的就是小黄龙。 剧情的话虽然有争议但不影响游戏的整体表现。最后的真结局的boss战真的很帅， 跟开场的大战首尾呼应真的很令人惊喜。期待之后的DLCs.",Recommended,988,100.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

It might start off slowly, but once you get the hang of it, it truly shines, like Sun Wukong (haha). It’s not meant to be an easy game—while it’s not too difficult if you like these kind of games its not hard except 1-2bosses, but if you are only here to casually play or chill without a challenge you will be disappointed so the best phrasing is:This is a very unique, good and special game, but it's definitely not for everyone.Please let go of your political or “woke” concerns, this game is a masterpiece in many ways and it's just simply useless and dumb to force any ""present"" problem into the picture.UI: Don’t miss the OST, it’s incredibly good!",Recommended,791,26.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

It's a top-notch project, worth every penny spent on it.Yet it has some minor issues, but this is more to warn that it's not your skill or pc, or feeling that something is wrong, it's just the game:- combat is fluid, yet sometimes the game doesn't read your inputs, even if you stand still or simply walk;- a lot of backtracking;- some secrets are not just unobvious – there's zero indication that some secret exists;- invisible walls everywhere, don't expect to be able to jump or hug walls, or climb up some rubble or roof;- some bosses are extremely difficult compared to the rest of the game;- at the same time – the majority of fights are too easy, and bosses can be permastunned, which takes away a chunk of enjoyment from defeating the boss.Surely there are more tiny details.

I don't say it lightly when I say that this is one of the, if not the best game I've played in the past 5 years.The art is amazing and the mastery of lighting and scenery is just beyond anything I've seen so far. I usually don't care for graphics as long as the art direction is good. This game had me flabbergasted by the quality of the visual it's able to deliver. Every location you visit, every chapter you move through will offer some of the best landscapes and sights I've seen in a game in a very long time. You can feel the love the devs had for the base material and it shows through and through.Gameplay-wise the feel is incredible, the movement and combat is perfectly ironed out. When you start to read the subtle movements of your ennemies and properly react and hit back, it is truly satisfying and feels so rewarding.The difficulty is a bit steep at first but the further you progress and unlock more power, the easier your journey gets. There are still some hidden bosses that will put everything you have to the challenge.The first campain playthrough should last about 40-50h if you take your time and explore and it takes about 15/20 more if you want to unlock all the achievements.

But that's kind of the problem- I'm really struggling to get into it so far, and there isn't anything that's really grabbed me to pull me in. Up until this point, there hasn't been anything in the storytelling that has caused an emotional reaction within me.So far, my experience is that the game is too combat heavy, and the combat is astonishingly clumsy and unsatisfying for the price tag. For the standard mobs, button mashing is just as effective as using actual tactics. On the flip side, the bosses I've encountered so far are way over leveled. I find myself fast traveling to earlier points so I can kill the trash mobs again and collect more sparks to beef my toon up, rather than leveling through natural progression.I'll give it another 4-5 hours to change my recommendation, but if it doesn't hook me by then I'll leave the thumbs down and move on.",Not Recommended,762,4.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

The details of the environment are amazing but for a game with many secrets, you need to cut the BS with low hanging cliffsides or massive gaps in forest/bushes which clearly are inviting you to explore... to be met with a invisible wall.There's no punishment to death, at allSome voice actors chosen for the english voices are... a weird choice, it seemed so off to me with the MC / 1 other character i've seen so far (just started chapter 4).Overall the games one of the best released in the past few years but the competition isn't really strong these days.",Recommended,1476,29.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

Mostly though invisible walls (everywhere!) and enemy hitboxes, there are a few hitboxes were the autotarget is just not on your side. Still a great game and I might even go for a new game + if I ever feel like it!",Recommended,379,36.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

14922,"It's an amazing game if you play it Rouge-like more than Souls-like because this is a Rouge-Souls-type game. I recommend that those who don't know the stories of Wukong and the Journey to the West read it because it's not exactly lore-giving, but the Journal is a great way to get into the Lore of the characters to build some background.The best thing to do is grind your ass off to level 30 by the end of Chapter 1 if you want to have a bit more of a chance in the fights for Chapter 2.Keep cultivating your skills and Spark points and take advantage of being able to move them around at the Shrines, remember to check everywhere for items and really DO fight all of the little side bosses because you may shoot yourself later in the foot if you don't. Be sure to PRACTICE your dodging and attacks because these bosses are no joke they beat ass!The better you use the Sparks, it affects your Stamina, Health and so on for later, the better your spark lay out and better your Gourds and Soaks the better you can survive.This game is absolutely beautiful, don't let the smaller map of Chapter 1 fool you it gets more overwhelming soon after in terms of nooks and crannies, and all the fights just get HARDER and HARDER as you go, and the amount of them and ambushes you get into are...ooof.Remember to take breaks if you need to because you WILL get angry and frustrated, don't break controllers and make sure to touch grass at some point between sessions.HAVE FUN! And don't forget to Enjoy the game for what it is and not based off what it ISN'T, because this ISN'T Dark Souls it is its own game so please respect the DEVs and their hard work.I LOVE this Game!!!!",Recommended,1356,34.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

The lore is heavy and it fits well if you know the journey to the west story, otherwise the story will be a bit overwhelming and confusing. The general plot will make sense but individual characters and story beats will seem unfamiliar to you. Combat and boss fights is where this game shines. Never expected to see so many diverse boss fights and builds. The game leans more on RPG mechanics but not too much. It's a solid 8/10. Was hoping for more exploration and some secrets seem so ambiguous that it needs a google search. If you enjoyed God of War, or any third person melee combat game then you will definitely like this. Also UE5 on this game is a testament to the future of games. The graphics are truly breathtaking. And the game is more immersive in the original language rather than English.

Overall, the game is a 7/10 for me and below is what I like or dislike about it:The Good:1. Stunning graphics2. Unique boss fights3. Beautifully done cutscenes4. Fun combat:1. Map and level design - be warned that there is NO map in this game. Coupled with the fact that there are invisible walls on what look to be walk-able paths, navigation can be frustrating.2. Wonky hit boxes - issue is very obvious when you deal with certain bosses. Especially those with large character model:Difficulty: I would say it's tough but very manageable. This is coming from someone who does not have much experience in souls-like action games.Story: Most of it is told in the journal entry rather than through story cutscenes.

While I agree that the lack of map makes it a bit hard to navigate some bigger areas in the game, it is still more than manageable. I didn't find any of these two to be as frustrating as some people claim, but to each their own. Something I liked a lot were the music videos played after chapters and the anecdotes you could read after defeating enemies.

To make matters worse, after encountering one boss and deciding to go get some levels; I wandered into another boss-fight that despawned the first one! I'll be honest that annoyed the hell out of me.Ultimately, if you're excited about playing it go for it.

The short movies after each chapter are the highlight of this game!A few bosses do a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moves, but at the same time, you can do a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moves to counter them. Well balanced overall.Some map areas were terrible to navigate, as there aren't good landmark points to keep track of them (noting down direction for paths usually works).And some quests were very confusing, unless you stumble onto it by luck or look it up (mad tiger).Performance is usually good, some frame drops while encountering massive environment or particles (chapter 3, chapter 6 rock boss).

15093,I managed... well while not 100% percenting the game... I did managed to beat the final boss... twice... enough said you have to look up steps to find out where the superboss of the game is... and got the true final ending... I have only a few words to say... this game is great... it tells a good tale though I do have issues...Some parts of the story are a bit cryptic so you MAY want to look up the source material to get a better understanding and this is DOUBLE IMPORTANT SO YOU DON'T GET THIS ON A NG+ cycle... look up a guide to find the hidden secret bosses and you will thank me... and probably curse me out on a few bosses... and second... performance is... WOW levels of bad in a few places... granted this is one of THE latest games for PC on Steam so I could be having issues running the game if some of my PC is outdated but I have EVERYTHING set to the lowest it could go and I still had issues with framerate and have FSR or whatever upscaling tech set to the LOWEST rendering scale.... in some battles... the framerate was... OK... held above 30 FPS... sweet chaos do NOT play this on Steam Deck... you can mod it all you like but unless you master the game inside and out... DON'T!... some of these bosses in this game make Elden Ring bosses tame in comparison... and I have yet to play the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC but something tells me it maybe easier then this game for a few reasons...Still again if the performance is boosted and some bosses are nerfed to not be so cheap... well I would say this game is game of the year... or close to it... again performance and some bosses with occasional jank hit boxes bring it down to an 8 or 9 out of 10... if you want a Sun Wukong game... THIS is the one... Dragonball games maybe good but some have NOTHING on the OG Monkey King in some fights but again... make sure to have a beefy PC or get the lowest settings to get the best out of this game if you want good FPS and what not.,Recommended,1567,54.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15119,"I remember being a kid and playing games like Fable and Castlevania and thinking what games would be like in the future. I would stop and stare in awe at the leaves and the trees, or the water and the rocks. I would lose total focus, if even for a split second, trying to picture how they could make this look ANY better. We all joked, we said it would eventually look like real life. We weren't wrong.Black Myth: Wukong is a different direction for me these days. In the age of Hero Shooters and the death of BR's, I hadn't been able to actually invest time into a game like this. As someone who isn't interested in the difficulty of souls-like games, this wasn't initially on my radar regardless. I would be lying if I said I heard about this game before release but its true. I took a gamble on getting it just because of what I had been reading. I firmly believe this gamble paid off.Wukong is literally the game I imagined as a kid walking through games like Fable and Castlevania. Completely immersive visual experience combined with a healthy skill tree, unique combat experiences, and a new twist around each corner. I was even more impressed when I heard that this was Game Science' first release. How? How is it that a company relatively new to video games creation can do this? I think it's their love for the game itself that created such a masterpiece. This wasn't about money, it wasn't about trends, it was just some people got together and who wanted to make a fun video game.Graphically, this game is leagues above anything. I haven't seen anything like it in my 25 years with video games. The game does have its frustrations, however. Lack of a double jump feature, block or crouch feature, and a map feature seems like a commonplace thing that should exist here. The game felt awfully linear and at times it did feel like an endless boss rush. But I believe that is how the game should be played.Wukong is a hill. They start you on top, give you a small taste of absolute carnage and power, and then kick you down a flight of stairs. While the journey's are rarely unique from player to player, it enables itself a unit of storytelling that is not currently rivaled. It makes video games fun again, and I really enjoyed my time with it. I look forward to DLC and sequels.92/100",Recommended,1877,54.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

There are other more mechanically sound AAA action games with better level design and pacing, but this game was made with so much heart and soul (not to be confused with ""polish""), which is such an incredibly rare thing in AAA - it shows in every aspect. This industry is terribly self-referential and refuses to look outside the ~10 things that dominate their cultural space (all pertaining to western hegemony), so after the 700th Star Wars game and the 1200th game on Norse mythology and fantasy based on Tolkien or D&D - this is such a breath of fresh air. There is actual diversity in the game - diversity of thought and diversity of philosophy. Game reminded me why I enjoyed playing these big spectacles once upon a time (my playtime these days outside of work is otherwise dominated by indie games, barring a few), and why I joined the industry in the first place.Reviewing it from a personal angle - because everything else about this game has been said a million times already and there's enough info out there to gauge whether this is your cup of tea or not.",Recommended,915,49.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15179,"Product refundedWhat is a good game? Elden Ring is truly a good game, with good details, graphics, gameplay, physics, environment, and other aspects. Instead of being extremely perfunctory and cutting corners in terms of design other than graphics, as in Black Myth, which was released many years later than Elden Ring, the physics design of Black Myth is seriously flawed. Look at the weight sensation of fragments splashing after the building jar is broken in Black Myth, which is obviously wrong. Moreover, as an action game, Black Myth does not have any special attack actions, such as backstabbing sneak attacks, executions, or timely blocking counterattacks. It only has a perfunctory skill design to replace counterattacks, and there is no timely calculation of combat scenes like the God of War. There is also no special combat screen that requires timely response and input of special buttons. Black Myth has no special attack actions, which is purely perfunctory. Black Mythology also has various perfunctory manifestations such as air walls and lack of architecture and indoor environment. Simply put, the design essence and concept of Black Mythology are completely focused on perfunctory and cutting corners, using a Unreal Engine 5 and then plagiarizing the action design of other games (such as a certain boss in the game completely plagiarizing the actions of a wolf crazy ape). Other aspects of design are simply done in the direction of cutting corners as much as possible, and even the optimization is too lazy to do well. As long as there is any criticism that exposes the truth about Black Myth, it relies on the navy to create rhythm, confuse right and wrong, and mislead others. In other words, the marketing of Black Myth relies not on game quality, but on the good graphics created by Unreal Engine 5 to cover up game design perfunctory and patriotic hype of the navy, and forcibly conceal the voices of exposing the truth to deceive players into purchasing. There is no other possibility. The key is that if a game is called good only based on good graphics quality without discussing other aspects of design, then all future games will be good games, because the graphics quality of future games will only be better than those of current games. Therefore, measuring the quality of a game solely based on graphics quality is purely ignorant. Furthermore, supporting low-quality games will only worsen the gaming environment, leading to an increasing number of low-quality games and a decreasing number of good games. This is because if a product can win the market solely through factors other than product quality (such as hype, appearance, etc.), who would still put in the effort to improve product quality. So only supporting games with really good quality like Elden Ring will make the gaming environment better.什么叫好游戏，艾尔登法环才叫真的好游戏，从细节到画质到玩法到物理感到环境等等各个方面都不错才叫真的好游戏。而不是像黑神话那样除了画质其他方面的设计都敷衍至极偷工减料，黑神话是一个比艾尔登法环推出时间要晚很多年的游戏，而黑神话的物理感设计居然严重错误，看下黑神话里的建筑坛子打破后碎片飞溅的重量感明显是错误的，还有黑神话作为一个动作游戏居然没有任何特殊攻击动作，没有背刺偷袭，没有处决，也没用及时格挡反击，只有个敷衍的技能设计替代反击，也没有像战神那样的及时演算战斗情景，也没有考验及时反应需要输入特殊按键的特殊战斗画面，黑神话完全没有任何特殊攻击动作纯属敷衍至极。黑神话还有空气墙和缺乏建筑和室内环境等等其他各种敷衍的体现，简单说黑神话的设计本质和理念完全就是只朝着敷衍和偷工减料的方向在设计，使用一个虚幻5然后在把其他游戏的动作设计剽窃些（比如里面某个BOSS就完全是剽窃只狼疯猿的动作），然后其他方面的设计就是怎么能敷衍就怎么做只朝着尽可能偷工减料的方向做，甚至连优化都懒得做好。只要出现任何批评黑神话曝光出真相的内容就靠水军去带节奏混淆是非误导其他人，说白了黑神话的营销靠的不是游戏品质，靠的只是虚幻5制造的好画质假象来掩饰游戏设计敷衍和水军爱国情怀炒作并且强行掩盖曝光真相的声音来忽悠玩家购买没有其他可能性。关键如果只用画质好不用谈其他方面的设计就叫好游戏，那么以后出的游戏就都是好游戏了，因为以后的游戏画质只会比现在的游戏更好，所以只以画质衡量游戏好坏纯属愚昧的体现。还有就是支持劣质游戏只会恶化游戏环境，让劣质游戏越来越多让好游戏越来越少，因为如果商品只需要靠商品质量以外的事物（比如炒作比如外表假象等等）也能赢得市场那么谁还会用心费劲去做好商品质量呢。所以只支持像艾尔登法环这样质量真的好的游戏才会让游戏环境变得更好。",Not Recommended,3141,1.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15183,"I wanted to wait until I beat this game to call it bad. This game was designed to be frustrating, not difficult. Coming from 100% Elden Ring, this game has terrible camera during many fights, terrible targeting to add to the terrible camera. That makes a lot of things that might be bearable unbearable. Bosses that have segments of invulnerability while also being able to damage the player is terrible design. Some very notable bosses read your inputs which is also terrible design. The basic combat is repetitive and doesn't encourage much experimentation outside of transformations. Two or three basic strategies take care of 95% of bosses. This is all to say that you will build up a heavy attack and wait for the right moment only for a boss to smack you out of the attack you waited 15 seconds to prepare. It's nothing but frustrating and doesn't lend to the power fantasy at all.It is a labor of love and it shows. I thought the game was beautiful and the animations were well done and the skill tree impressed me at first, but beyond that, it's insufferable to run into an invisible wall every 30 feet and constantly run into enemies that have attacks specifically designed to interrupt your combos. I would love to love this game, but trying to wonder about how they allowed so many egregious decisions into their game makes me incredibly disinterested in continuing to play it for the 100%.",Not Recommended,1156,44.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15190,"Black Myth Wukong is a beautiful game that had its enjoyment diminished through a variety of clunky design choices and has a hollow narrative that is masked by its rich cultural nuances.It is without a doubt that the visuals and animations in this game are breathtaking with unique and fun challenging boss battles along with interesting move sets. This is not something that needs to be explored further. I will be doing more of a critical take to the game so then the same mistakes do not appear in Game Science's future releases (Thus the negative review).What needs to be addressed are the questionable design choices that, by themselves, can be tolerated, but put together, causes frustrating and clunky game-play.- Lack of auto rest at save point. Although not a giant issue, implementing this would have allowed a smoother game-play where you do not need to click rest at the save points to reset your status. There has been many times during my exploration where I have found a save point, traversed away, find a boss, use potions, and then realising that I am at half hp with no mana.- On the topic of save points, there is a specific debuff in one area that does not get reset after resting. This made fighting a certain boss especially frustrating since after each retry, one will need to wait for the debuff to clear in order to have a fair fight. This wait took around 1-2 minutes where the only thing to do is to twiddle your thumbs.The next few are design choices that individually, are fine but collectively, very frustrating.- Lack of map. This makes it hard to traverse but make for an interesting exploration experience. However, it does make it hard to find places where you may have missed.- Invisible walls. Given such beautiful scenery, it is frustrating that there are so many areas that look like it could be explored be blocked off with the boundaries of the map. This is actually one of the issues caused by having such beautiful visuals. It prevents you from intuitively knowing where places can be explored and what areas are completely out of reach, making you attempt to jump onto a platform only to be disappointed that it is inaccessible.- NPC positioning. Some NPCs are hidden away quite obscurely and sometimes found relatively late in a chapter making them easy to miss.- Most of the bosses are fun and some are an exhilarating challenge. This is because they are fair fights. Unfortunately, some bosses have an unfair abilities which causes you to die in a way that seems like dumb luck rather than lack of skill unless you have a specific item from a side quest.Now putting things together, a lack of map makes exploration interesting and, like the developers put it, increased an immersive experience. However, with invisible walls everywhere, traversing became a chore as I find myself continuously running into and bounced off wall after wall. This made some hidden areas hard to find since they are placed in areas where, after continuously ramming into wall, one could assume is another wall.Without a map, sometimes one can feel like they have explored everywhere already and decide to fight the final boss of a chapter only to see them use an ability which makes them seem unfair. But surely you have looked through every nook and cranny no? Turns out you missed a turn somewhere and missed an NPC quest line to give you an item to counteract the unfair ability. If the NPC starts closer to the start of the map on a main traversing location, it would be forgivable since you become aware of their existence and know to explore through their quest. This give you a better idea on whether or not you have explored through the entire map.- Some exotically shaped bosses, although interesting and have beautiful move sets, also have some annoying hit boxes. There are times where I find myself running as close as possible to a boss and performed a full combo only to have it completely miss due to the hit box and the space it takes up be different.Story wise, it is a sequel to Journey to the West, paying homage to the original material but completely neglecting its overarching theme and motif. Unfortunately, the game's story lacks depth and is void of any sort of meaningful development to the character you play and to those around you, apart from a selected few. Thus, it is also another victim of a Chinese animation/game narrative displaying a large variety of rich cultural elements without the depth and backbone to hold it together. AKA, the toppings without the bread.All in all, Black Myth Wukong was a visual spectacle but as a game and a story device, has many flaws which I am unable to give it a free pass on, especially because I want to love this game. As frustrating as some aspects were, I still had a decent experience (As can be seen from me 100% ing the game).6.5/10",Not Recommended,3988,80.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15200,"Immediately pointing out the flaw(s) in gaming journalism... Although this was on the outskirts of my radar I bought the game as protest of sorts. I am ALWAYS eager to support game studios that put innovation ahead of monetization & profit...So This game fits the bill dead on as a portrayal of one of the oldest tales in eastern culture.The graphics are great and even on the lowest settings can be very visually appealing. The chosen one can clearly tell that painstaking detail was put in place meticulously.The game play and combat systems are fairly polished for a game of this caliber. I was honestly expecting less from the start after hearing this was a first time affair for what was primarily a mobile game developer, but it IS IN FACT A SOLID GAME PLAY experience.It is NOT a souls like but the difficulty curve is up there at the ranks with no obvious or immediate way to change a difficulty setting... BUT there are ways to give yourself the advantage through allotting points and building your character's stats, which is not written in stone and can ALWAYS be changed at checkpoints.All in all, I'd say this is a winner and definitely an experience for players who enjoy STORY DRIVEN games and for those who enjoy setting their own difficulty curves for their liking.",Recommended,1059,182.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

I found my game play felt way better investing as much as possible into the light attack combos and dodge mechanics early on. This opens up the melee combat a little more with some damage boosts and dodge mobility, allowing you to dodge in the middle of combos and still continue the chain and finish with heavy attacks. I felt a lot more comfortable being bosses face's and got better at performing perfect dodges at least half the time. It seems silly to invest in something like a slight distance increase to how far you can hit your first melee attack on an enemy, but putting points in these over spells that take a long time to charge really balanced out the fights and I've been having a lot of fun.",Recommended,732,17.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15209,"TL;DR: It's a good game. It's not the best game of the year, it's not even the best game in the genre, but it's solid and totally worth the price tag.I have a very solid rig, I meet all the recommended specs and surpass them to no small extent.The game suffers input lag due to some settings and graphical tech that it uses. Turning that off removes the input lag, but frames are suddenly unreliable. I have moments where i'll be at a solid 60+ and drop down to 5-10 frames in especially key moments of enemy attacks.Again, I have a very powerful computer, I should not be having this issue.It really needs some more optimization, not much, but it does need some.I don't really understand the story all that much, but that's fine because that's kind of a hallmark of this genre of game anyway. The characters are hilariousThe gameplay had me a little worried. Nioh is what was used as a comparison for many to this games gameplay and I did not like that idea overmuch, as Nioh wanted to combine action combat with soulslike gameplay and that does not mix well.Big telegraphed attacks that deal a lot of damage and require you to recognize the tells and avoid them, exploiting openings between them with one or two attacks here or there. Yet the combat system encourages the use of combo's with lengthy animations you cannot cancel out of to deal the damage necessary to open up the target to damage.Thankfully, Wukong found a genuinely good blend for this. Your basic attack string has three solid fast hitting attacks, the last two of which can be dodge canceled. Your fourth attack is a longer animation that does a solid number of hits, like wise can be dodge cancelled. The last attack cannot be dodge cancelled, but for most enemies it's almost garunteed to cause stagger.Heavy attacks are specific to styles you have active, with each doing a specific animation that provides specific and powerful benefits to it's use.Each heavy attack also has a mixed combo you can trigger directly after any light attack, each with their own effects.This makes the combat a lot less complex and nuanced than Nioh's, but makes it a perfect fit for that combination of stylistic combo attack action vs boss fight pattern memorization.The world, and graphics thereof, is absolutely phenomenal, a genuine artistic masterpiece worthy of the journey to the west.The soundtrack is so good, I was worried it would be distracting in fights, and yet instead it fits so perfectly that I'm genuinely curious if the enemies are scripted to do certain attacks in key with the score.Overall it's a phenomenal game that came out almost completely perfect, barring a few rough spots that need adjusting.EDIT: So there's a recurring issue that needs to be addressed with this game. A lot of people are complaining about it not making game of the year or whatever award. I do think the game is good, I don't think it's good enough for an award.Graphically, it's great.Story wise, phenomenal.But there are a lot of issues that showcase the studio's lack of experience.For example, this game's challenge does not come from the combat system, but rather from memorization. Every single enemy, and I do mean EVERY SINGLE ONE, only has a handful of attack chains they do. It's quite easy to memorize every single enemies attack chain, and get so good at timing it that you never get touched.That's not really a big challenge though, Arcade games did that all the time back in the early days of gaming.Pretty much all the souls like games are like that except for three, all three of which can genuinely be called amazing games.Sekiro, where some enemy AI would change their attacks MID COMBO based on your position.Bloodborne, which encouraged aggression and reaction rather than timing and memorization.And Elden Ring, which has a greater emphasis on pattern recognition than it does Timing.But This game is very much a ""memorize attack patterns"" style of game. Your ability to react to the enemy is meaningless, only your ability to recognize which attack chain their doing, and time your movements accordingly.On top of that, lots of reports coming in of mechanical issues with the games that, as I stated when I first made this review, showcase a need for improved optimization.",Recommended,3523,58.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15240,"Black Myth: Wukong is shaping up to be the number one game of 2024, and not just because it features a monkey with a magic staff- though let's be honest, that's a pretty compelling reason. Imagine if Donkey Kong decided to trade in his bananas for a quest to save the world; that's the vibe here.The game is a delightful mix of action and RPG elements, akin to a monkey swinging through the jungle while dodging political banana peels. It's visually stunning, like a gallery of monkey art where every brushstroke is a spell waiting to be unleashed. Players can freeze foes in time, summon monkey clones, and unleash chaos, making combat feel like a dance-off where everyone forgot the choreography but still managed to bust a move.Inclusivity is woven into the game's fabric, drawing from rich Chinese Mythology, which is as refreshing as finding a hidden Soul Remigration Pill. While some might argue about it's difficulty, it's like trying to convince a monkey to stop climbing trees.. good luck with that! =)In a year filled with contenders. Black Myth: Wukong stands tall, swinging from the vines of creativity and humor, proving that sometimes, the best games are the ones that don't take themselves that seriously, instead they thrive on pouring their heart and soul into game development, leaving us with a masterpiece!Hats off to devs!!",Recommended,1119,283.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15249,"This is the first review I've done since I created my steam account. The game is so good it compelled me to do so. Black Myth: Wukong is a great AAA game, with great action and beautiful, stunning visuals.The main draw of the game is, of course, the action. You have a simple, yet highly engaging and effective combat system. The main combat flow is to use light attacks to fill your Focus gauge and use Focus Points to unleash powerful heavy attacks. Your main defensive option consists in dodging incoming attacks. If you do exactly at the right time, you do a Perfect Dodge, earning Focus, slowing time down and opening counter attack windows. I can't stress how Perfect Dodge makes the combat that much more engaging, allowing extreme aggressiveness on your part. You know the game is good when you can enter That ""State of Mind"", where everything you do is just perfect and flows beautifully, you dodge every move perfectly, your Focus gauge is always up, you don't leave any room for breathing, you just Are. You also can mix up with a limited amount of versitile spells that can stop enemies in time or parry hits.Wukong's main ability was his 72 Transformations, and the game revels in this lore. You have access to a variety of transformative spells as well, that allow you to take form of plenty of NPCs you meet in your Journey. Spirit Summons also work the same way, albeit with a short transform time. The sheer number of transformations works to spice up the already perfect combat. Overall, 10/10 for combat.The visuals and artistic design are breathtaking. Chinese mythology nerds like me are crying tears of joy. This game is a work of art, literally. Every scenery, every sound, every character, every voice acting, every tiny little pixel of this game works phenomenally to bring that unique Chinese myth vibe to life and does so in a spetacular way. Forrest, valleys, deserts, moutains, every region that encompasses Chinese mythology is extremely well represented here, with stunning graphics.Performance-wise, I've had a few issues. I played on a RTX4070, with cinematic graphics (the highest), DLSS and hardware acceleration on and ray tracing off at 1080p. I've managed to hit a constant and stable 70FPS throughout the game while enjoying the beautiful graphics. With medium ray tracing on, however, even the second highest grpahics couldn't reach stable 60FPS. I've also had some few graphic bugs while playing, such as textures not loading properly during cutscenes, frame drops, and the main menu freezing/bugging out and main opening cutscene not playing. Nothing major, as far as I'm concerned, but your mileage may vary. Overall, 10/10 for graphics and artistic design, that goes down to a 8.5/10 due to some performance issues that hopefully will be patched.The level design is good, but it is severely hindered by the lack of a map or any tool to direct you and the dreaded invisible walls. While you can speedrun chapters by just going through a straight line to the end of the chapter, later maps offer a variety of different paths to explore, bosses to fight, items to discover and pills to ingest to strengthen your character and NPC questlines, so exploration is highly encouraged. However, without any sort of map, it is extremely easy to get lost, and the choice of limiting exploration with invisible walls offers a lot of frustation to the player. This could be circumvented by applying any other technique to limite player movement, such as actual physical walls or trees or anything else. However, you eventually get used to it. This is the game's main weakness, but it wasn't any deal breaker for me. 9.5/10 for good content in the maps, that gets down to 7/10 because exploring isn't that great.This game is just great. I honestly think the price tag is worth it, There are a handful of games I've paid full price and bought it on release. This was one of them and it was worth every single bit. I've enjoyed every second I've spent in game.What really compelled me to write this review is that this is the first game I've played that I could actually feel that was a work of love. You know the developers love the Journey to the West story, that they love their culture, that they pulled every bit of their souls into creating something they actually love. The mythology and culture is treated with so much respect, so much beauty, so much passion. There are Music Videos after each chapter is completed that retells a story, and each MV is done in a different artstyle. I felt it out-of-place initially, but then it dawned on me that the game is a love letter from chinese people to traditional chinese culture. It was very touching.My final rating is 10/10. Is it truly, unobjectively, a 10/10 game? I don't know. But in my heart, it is. This is a phenomenal work of art and of love. I will treasure it and I encourage everyone, even if you are not familiar with chinese mythology, to try it. Just so that you can feel the passion that fueled every artist that made this game.",Recommended,4152,72.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 11
15250,"As a certified god gamer I can't speak for everyone but despite never having touched a soulslike ""three dimensional RPG action-fighting game"", I got very quickly used to the controls on the controller. The big baby head miniboss is a perfect start to this game as being annoyingly challenging as it is for first time players, it forces you to learn the fundamentals so well, and it's really satisfying coming back on ng+ with the 17,000 pound whack stick to absolutely destroy him in 20 seconds as atonement for killing you 30 times on your first run.I've heard negative reviews about the fighting and how it gets monotonous, but let me tell you this, NO two bosses are exactly the same. NO two bosses are even remotely similar. And as you progress, actually put points into different stances and actually learn how to parry/""see through the enemy"", and you will never find yourself saying that the gameplay or fighting is monotonous.As the game progresses and you get further into the chapters, the biomes you explore become super expansive, especially in chapter 4. There are some secrets you absolutely must just search up how to find because you literally cannot find them otherwise.Once all is said and done, the secret boss Erlang shen waits for you in the great pagoda, which was about the most fun ive ever had in a fight in this game. It taught me patience, reservedness, and it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spectacle. One thing I really enjoyed about it is how he reacts uniquely to all of your transformations, which was such a neat surprise, I wish I could go back and keep dying to him to see what he said for every single oneOverall this game is enormous, absolutley worth the 60 dollars, and even beginner friendly. If you've never played a soulslike, consider this your gateway drug. If you have played a soulslike, consider this a challenge.Also, side note: This game becomes MUCH more interesting to follow if you learn the lore. I recommend watching a video or two on wukong's journey or specifically the cultural references in this game before you play so that you know whats going on, especially in the mid-chapter animations/""music videos""",Recommended,1777,75.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15269,"Not as good as the majority is making it out to be. Not a souls like, more of a god of war/nioh boss focused game. Bosses have bizarre cutscenes that happen mid fight and have to be repeated/skipped again if you lose. Bosses also have odd mechanics that have no tell when to dodge as well as passive things they do where they can't be attacked and the only purpose seems to be to slow the fight down. Bosses, more than the normal enemies, have terrible hitboxes where you are visually hitting the enemies body and no hitbox is being affected.Invisible walls all over the place that limit what looks like a massive world. Large scope is used in the world with no enemies or hidden treasure which leads to some dull moments. Level design is ok but you often feel like you got under rewarded for exploring and there is also no real complexity to finding the ""hidden path"" besides that sometimes its so dark you didn't see the small crack in the wall.I don't know that I wouldn't recommend this game, but there is a lot of jank this game has in it that a lot of major media isn't talking about.",Recommended,887,41.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15273,"Product received for freeAfter 13 hours and over 30 different bosses defeated, I simply cannot, for the life of me, figure out how this game has received so much acclaim. Maybe the combat just doesn't click for me. But half of the bosses I've faced are beyond frustrating for a number of reasons. From bosses with gimmicks that aren't fun, to long strings of attacks that can't be interrupted, this game's boss roster peaked with the tutorial boss I'm almost positive you cannot even lose to, and has been nothing but a frustrating slow slide downhill with little to nope of going back up any time soon. \It feels like the game wants you to play it like Sekiro, aggressive and always pushing back against a boss's onslaught. But that becomes hard when any boss smaller than boulder comes with strings that can last upwards of 20 seconds at a time with no chance for retaliation and the fact that they can often combo those immediately, these boss fights stop feeling like combat challenges and more ""how many times can you successfully press dodge until the boss lets you hit it a few times."" Combine this with factors like a lack of poise or super armor on most attacks that makes riskier strategies like trading near impossible, combat quickly becomes incredibly stale and repetitive.The issues with combat extend outside of boss fights as well. I found many regular enemies frustrating on their own. Combine this with the game's insistence of constantly throwing multiple enemies at you at once it leads to constant unfun encounters where you get comboed to death with little reprieve due to mismatched move sets and aggression. And god forbid you have to deal with an encounter that has more than one ranged enemy at one time. Their uncanny accuracy and ridiculous rates of fire often left me getting stunlocked for upwards of half my health.In the end, I did receive this game for free as a gift from a close friend. That helps soften the blow a lot, but does little to actually quell my frustration with the title. I have other issues with the game than the combat, but since that's what most people play these types of games for, this is what I chose to focus on with my review. Overall this is a game that has a lot of potential that is squandered on poor design choices that make combat stale by the time you hit the 20th boss fight. The extremely bloated boss roster definitely contributes to these issues a lot. I never thought I would find myself wishing the game had reused more bosses, as it's clear the quantity of unique ones left the developers creativity thinning well before the end of the game. If the game gets better after Chapter 3's midpoint, I will not know, as I do not plan to force myself to continue with a game I am not enjoying.",Not Recommended,2267,15.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15388,"After 52.7 hours of playtime [including (toilet) breaks] and getting 72/81 Achievements (I did everything there is to do for a first playthrough, the rest I guess is for NG+, getting more Curios/Items or whatever; the Achievements are pretty cryptic) I finally finished Wukong.Here are my thoughts.You play as Wukong from League of Legends...nevermind. You play as ""The Destined One"" who may or may not be Wukong. I won't spoil anything here, the Game is overloaded with lore anyways. Based on ""The Journey to the West"" (which I never read; I only ever played ""Enslaved"" and can't remember much of it) you - I guess - journey through the West and do stuff.When you first start the Game there is a ""long"" Shader Compilation going on but you only have to endure it once and I remember it taking longer in Games like Uncharted 4, The Last of Us or the Horizon Games.So it's not bad.First time in the Menu and I already noticed my PC got really loud for the first time ever and also quite warm. I didn't know the temperature, I just felt it. Not sure if the Sound came from my Fans or my SSD. But yeah, my PC got a workout. (Specs on my profile for anyone curious.)On High Settings the Game ran well for the most part, that means I got my stable 1080p 60 fps, just here and there were a few drops into the 50s and the lowest 48 sometimes.So yeah, it ran well apart from a few more demanding zones.Also the Game looks really crisp, I felt the textures were really high res. It almost looks photorealistic at times, sometimes a little too photorealistic I think, which for me made some areas more boring to look at.I think with a more distinct artstyle this could've been ""solved"" but that may just be a ""me problem"".For me the Game suffered from texture pop-in which was pretty noticeable but things like that don't bother me that much. Same goes for some enemies which also popped in when they were farther away and the lighting seemed messed up in some areas as well.Otherwise this Game is a looker. Not THE best looking Game I ever played but certainly up there.The Animations are also very well done, really good visual package. And the Chapter Ending Cutscenes are also really great. Each ending cutscene is in a unique animated style be it animated or even a stop motion wool style. Hard to describe but really good.In the beginning I thought the combat felt good but not great. But after while of playing, it was really fun!Also I think that some people made the Game out to be it's own thing and not a Soulslike. After finishing I only agree a bit, because there is so much Souls DNA in the Game, that you COULD classify it as a Soulslike.The menus and the item descriptions remind you of a soulslike, you have your dodge button, you fight many bosses, you explore a linear world but it also branches out sometimes, you will do cryptic quests just like in soulslikes, you have your stamina meter but everything is just more forgiving here.For example: You don't lose anything when you die. You keep all the experience, all the items, there are no death runs at all. But still, there is a ton of Souls DNA here.Also I have to say that the Game is quite easy. Apart from a handful (literally 5) bosses where I needed more than 1-2 tries, this is more casual friendly than a souls game BUT I also have to acknowledge that some people seem to struggle with the Game/the bosses quite a bit (at least from what I read in many forums).Sound design is excellent, from the footsteps on different surfaces, to the environmental sounds and the combat sounds, all is pretty crisp and clear.Musically it's okay, there is not that much music, when there is, it's almost always subtle apart from the different boss tracks. Some drums, some strings, a flute here and there...I think overall it was pretty good.Voice Acting: I played in Chinese with English Subtitles, but overall I still enjoyed the Voice Acting. Only the wolves, they sounded more like hyenas, apart from that, pretty good!Also let me make clear, that even though the Game features over 80 (90?) unique (!) bosses, I wouldn't consider this a boss rush Game. There is still much to explore and to do apart from killing bosses.Regarding the Bossfights: They are absolutely beastly, literally and figuratively. Just excellent design and for the most part they are all unique. Just a few ""rehashed"" bosses when it comes to looks, but they still all have their own unique moveset and abilities. Just great!The Combat itself is like a mix between God of War meets a soulslike, I guess. And yeah, as mentioned it's pretty fun.There is something I didn't like that much. For example the invisible walls. Usually something like that doesn't bother me, but here it was extreme. Sometimes you think you can make it to an area (which was wide open) but nope, invisible wall. This is a thing that you will see throughout the whole Game.Apart from that it really got a AAA treatment (even more impressive, because after watching the credits, it felt like it was made by a AA studio because there were not THAT many people involved).Also just a few bugs here and there. Slow Walking sometimes makes you float or killing an enemy on a rock also makes their remains float. But nothing too wild.I also had only one crash where Steam and the Game crashed simultaneously and one boss punched me so hard, I flew into the next Are(n)a while the boss was still with half health in the arena, which forced me to restart the Game.Otherwise great experience.Also make no mistake. So many people said this is a linear Game. Yes, for the first Chapter maybe, then it gets bigger in Chapter 2, culminates in a very big Chapter 3 and 4 (which really could be confusing sometimes; I wish there was a map!), goes back to more linear in 5 and then dumps you in a really big Area in Chapter 6. It is not the ""you run from corridor to corridor"" Game as many reviewers stated.As mentioned, a map would've helped, especially when there are so many branching paths...And I want to be honest here: For 4 Bosses I looked up how to get to them because I just didn't want to miss out. Just before I finished a chapter, I checked a walkthrough to get the missing ""Journal Entries""/Bosses. Other than that it is great for a blind playthrough.So yeah, with all that being said, would I recommend Black Myth Wukong? Yes! This is a great Game. It is certainly not the best Game of all times, but it is really good, engaging, fun and the bosses are just soooooo good.I won't be jumping into NG+ yet, but when the DLC arrives (it was announced) then maybe another playthrough couldn't hurt...8.5/10!",Recommended,5419,52.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

It definitely lets you enjoy the game rather than lost in the progress.Game route can easily followed without losing your way along the process.

But regardless of difficulty I feel like I always enjoyed it.You have all kinds of build you can do, spirits, spells, weapons all are really good touch.Overall I am still in chapter 5 but I have been playing for the past week non stop without having annoyed on something and just enjoying the game in general.Normally I seach a lot things I forgot in the game since I want full completion but most of the stuff I searched are secret stuff that I missed last chapter.So I highly recommend anyone that has the budget for it.

15430,"Best game I've played since Elden Ring, easily a 10 for me and tied with ER which I never thought would ever happen. They're very different games of course but ultimately on a scale of fun and urge to keep playing it matches up easily. This is coming from someone who put 150 hours into ER within a span of 8 days with 5 hours of sleep a night, caffeine in the morning to get up quick, and sleeping pills to put me out all so that I could immerse myself into the world so believe me, I do not take this review lightly. I truly hope these devs make more games, or a massive dlc, something like that. And I'm not entirely sure how it would work, but a multiplayer mod or version of the game would be insane. Maybe scale up the enemies help to a ridiculous amount or something. The fact that Elden Ring made it work, I'm sure this can too.10/10 I would get it again, couldn't recommend enough. To any new players, don't avoid the first boss with the big head, I forget his name but it teaches you a lot. Some say the game is too hard, I say it's slightly too easy but I'm not too far into the game yet I'd imagine.

15439,"This game is severely over-hyped.The graphics, music, and cut scenes are awesome.The fundamental aspects of this game revolving around combat have a lot QoL issues that make this impossible for me to want to keep playing. See below for examples:Healing potion doesn't always work, spamming often uses more than intended. I have tested this outside of combat as well. I have NO idea how more people have not brought this up. It's infuriating.Immobilize (Freeze ability) just bugs out randomly, cool down is started as if you used it. Often times during a boss you need to cast this spell quickly to give some relief in the pace of combat. Several times this spell has cast, done nothing, and the cool down starts to countdown as if I have used it.Issues with ""Composure skill"" - this ability allows you to dodge attacks in the middle of light combo attacks. It doesn't always work.Other issues:- The spawn location when you die and reattempt Zhu Baije boss is such a baffling bad design, I can't believe the devs thought it was a good idea to make you walk for 3 minutes every time you respawn and reattempt that boss, JFC.- chapter 3 straight up sucks, you're stuck going in a circular prison for 2 hours.- Scorpion mini boss Chapter 4 - severely bugged. Multiple times wasn't able to attack because boss was glitched in strange position.- One of the coolest looking areas in the game, Purple Cloud Mountain, has awful screen tearing.

15457,"Pros: Challenging bosses, Anime-like fights, a lot of customisation to play style, non restrictive skill system ( you can change your talent points on a whim ), really cool looking creatures, good story-tellingCons: A lot of content can be missed out unless you follow a guide online. Some of the prerequisites to the secret areas and bosses are total BS. There is no in-game hint to actually figure it out and mostly happens by chance. Some Bosses can be fully locked out if you progress the story and it is not very obvious that it would happen. Then you have to replay the game to experience the fight. There is no map or what so ever, so you never know whether you are going down the story path or not, which makes it difficult to avoid it if you want to do side quests. One of the gear sets is completely unobtainable unless you do a second playthrough. Some bosses spam ridiculously long combos (8-9 hits in a row without a break) which can be really frustrating at times.I still love it over all. Boss fights are very dynamic, the story is interesting and you feel quite powerful once you get some skills unlocked and gear equipped.",Recommended,933,50.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

I never post reviews about games even if their bad, I only post about games when they are genuinely unplayable. I hope everyone else who buys this game doesn't face the same problems I did. I hope they never have to experience it because they don't have to buy this game. It's not a hard game, quite enjoyable when you do actually get to play it. If you really want to buy it, don't waste your money on a PC that the game won't let you use all of it, instead get it for playstation. Very dissapointing I drop $65 dollars on a game and it can't even do the simplist of things, like SAVE, SAVE MY GAME.

It's basically an indie game with a Triple A Skin.If you just look at the visuals you could believe this is a game as full as God of War, but it is not.If you were to watch any trailers you would think there is a dynamic story, but there is not.If you read the descriptors of the game and compare it to others, a 'souls-like' it is not.It's a fun game. It does not deserve the full price tag. Get it on discount and nothing more. Calling this a GotY is an insult to game developers that actually release a complete game.Anybody who says they like this game because they love Journey to the West makes sense because if you haven't seen Journey to the West you would understand this video game has no coherent story whatsoever.If this is China's first attempt at a Triple A style game it's a good start but at it's best it should be considered an action-indie game with the amount of flaws present.",Recommended,773,32.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

15480,"No game is without flaws, but Black Myth: Wukong is certainly a masterpiece.Gameplay is phenomal, with extensive creativity in regards to builds and lots of fun abilities/spells to use. While of course challenging like most souls-likes, it still feels extremely gratifying to beat that boss that kicked your ass for the past hour which i love.Game has lots of secrets, with a ""true ending"" which is very complicated to get, but grants access to one of my favorite (and hardest) boss-fights i've ever had the pleasure of fighting in a soulslike.Regarding secrets, the game's level design can feel very ""same-ey"" at times, so it's easy to get lost trying to scour places, but it never bothered me *too* much compared to what i've heard from others.Regarding the overall narrative: I knew pretty much nothing of The Journey To The West before playing, other than Sun Wukong was an OP monkey that swung a staff around, but the sheer amount of story to be told in this game really immersed me. From the beautiful cutscenes to all the little stories you can read in the game's bestiary. It is complimented evermore by an excellent score of music.My only real gripe is some issues with the controls, like how initiating one action (ex. healing) can prevent you from using other items/spells if you're too early on the trigger.I rate Black Myth: Wukong 9.5/10, and highly recommend anyone who's into third-person action games to give it a shot.",Recommended,1192,50.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

My game did also crash quite a few times but i do not know if that is the games fault or my PC, so i will not give to many minus points for that.

15513,"I have wrote exactly one review in my 14 or so years of using steam, and it's this review right now.I will organize this into things I liked and things I didn't like, and at the end my overall score (x/10).DISCLAIMER: This is my personal experience with the game and my thoughts. I also made it to the end of chapter 4 before feeling like I wanted to write this review. I do not care if 70 billion people think this is GOTY material. If you love the game, that's honestly great. There are a sincere lack of new, well made, and fun ""AAA"" games, and if you can find one that you like, I'm genuinely happy for you.Also, since I did not make it all the way through the game, I won't be making a judgement on the boss mechanics, hitboxs, etc. I know quite a few people had problems with that, but I did not encounter a similar problem.-----------------------------------------WHAT I LIKED:SETTING: There aren't that many games that cover Chinese mythology in detail, or at least not many that get as much media coverage as this game did. It's highly refreshing to see something other than high European fantasy (even though I'm a sucker for em). I haven't read Journey to the West or watched/listened to any media about it, but this game has made me more curious of the actual story and of Chinese mythology in general.GRAPHICS: Holy moly, this game is pretty. Even before the boss designs, the levels look amazing. There is a slight hiccup with each level looking a bit monochromatic (sand, sand, and more sand), but the vistas and key areas all follow their own theme, which matches the bosses and make them feel lived in by the actual creatures that you encounter. Additionally, the boss designs are all top tier. No real problems with the bosses on my end from a graphical standpoint. Animations, art design, and effects all look epic and make you feel pretty small at times, which is what I'm assuming they were going for.And of course all the later game armor sets and staves were sick as heck. (Too bad you can't get some staves until NG+)INTERFACE: Sleek and non-intrusive. All the things you can ask for. There was a learning curve to using the RT on the controller to access your other abilities, but once I got used to it, I was comboing my spirits and transformation with ease and was a highlight to the combat.-----------------------------------------:INVISIBLE WALLS: Yeah yeah, I know. I'm not going to wax poetic about the insurmountably liberal use of invisible walls and their intrusive and odd placements. However, there is one other huge gripe that I want to point out, and that is their use in boss arenas. If the boss can jump through the invisible wall and attack me through it. Sorry, that is just bad design. The last boss of chapter 2 was honestly one of my least favorite solely because of this. Thankfully, I didn't encounter it again on any other boss, and I don't know if it even happens again to my knowledge. But yeah, invisible wall bad.STORYTELLING: The translations for this game were challenging to understand, and I really had no idea of what was going on in the story. I understand that that might be due to the nature of how the original story is told. I also know that Game Science made a lot of changes to the story. So I'm not sure how true it is to the original or how that could affect the game's storytelling. Making adjustments to the translations to make it more understandable for players who haven't experienced this story before or this type of mythology and would have gone a long way .PERFORMANCE: The game is pretty, but man, they really turned the dial up too much some times. The frame drops in this game make certain bosses unplayable at times due to the gobsmacking amount of particle effects. Fighting any of the Loongs with their lightning might as well be actual lightning striking my computer, which is a shame since they are some of the cooler fights in the game. This also wasn't isolated to just one chapter, almost all the chapters I played through had some sort of performance issue at various points. I have no problem fighting Consort Radahn with his five million light particles or the Divine Beast with their various storm effects in Elden Ring, but god forbid I get lightning dragons or sand in this game.ENEMIES: This is an issue I had with Sekiro on my second and third playthrough. The regular joe-blow enemies and their frequency just prove to be an annoyance. They aren't particularly challenging or interesting and just serve to lengthen the play time. In a boss rush game with no other gameplay mechanics (i.e platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, etc) I do not care about anything else other than the bosses/story/combat. It would be a bit different if there was some diversity to the combat or gameplay, but that is a topic for later.COMBAT: And by later, I mean now. This one is going to be pretty lengthy since this is the driving point of the game, and I will split this up among a few key pain points of the combat.: Speaking of animations, what in tarnation is going on with the animation locking? I don't know if this is actually what people mean by ""animation locking"", but it is supremely annoying not being able to perform combat actions until full animations have been performed. Performing magic roots you in place and you must perform the entire character animation, even if the spell has already finished casting e.g freeze spell. Dodge rolls do not cancel animations like other action RPGS, which makes the combat feel very clunky. It also forces you into one or two specific ways to play the game.: Or lack thereof. The combat boils down to pretty much ""save focus for big hit"". There isn't a consistent way to CC the bosses, since some can't actually be knocked down or stunned. This makes the combat loop devolve into one-two light attacks until you have focus for a fully charged heavy. There is a skill that doesn't interrupt your light combo by dodge rolling. However, most of the bosses have 3-7 attack combos that time out that particular parameter. And yes, there are the ""varied combos"". I'll talk about those in detail later, but those have their own quirks that interrupt the flow combat substantially.: I've mentioned stagger previously, and it is honestly one of the main reasons I stopped playing for now. Bosses staggering me or knocking me down is no big deal. I expect these much more powerful enemies to knock me on my ass. However, when every regular enemy can stagger me out of my combos while I'm flying around with my staff, but I can only stagger them once or twice during a light combo, that just removes the fun. There a stat called tenacity in the game, but you don't get armor for it until way later. Just let me do cool stuff man.: I'm not going to sugar coat this. These are not good. I had such high hopes for the combat in general because of these, but I got majorly disappointed. These are just worse versions of the charged heavy attacks of their respective stances. They have a long recovery time after performing them that you end up getting hit 99% of the time after using them. The healing is cool, but worse than just using the bo staff that heals on 3 focus heavy attacks. And the so called ""counters"" can't be performed on the fly and have the narrowest window I've seen for a ""counter/parry"". If you want to parry, just use rock solid.There's more I'd like to write down, but I'm running out of room. These are the major points, good and bad, from my experience. TLDR: The game looks amazing, and is set in a woefully underappreciated mythology. However, the combat sucks a lot of fun from the game along with major performance issues.Maybe I was expecting too much or this wasn't really what I was looking for in an action RPG.

15555,"One of the best games I've played in a while. A perfect linear game for me. When it comes to open-world games, I prefer a more compact world with fewer side quests and distractions that don’t slow down story progression.If you enjoy exploration, build crafting, and boss fights—and don’t mind a few invisible walls—then you’d probably enjoy Black Myth: Wukong. While it might not surpass most FromSoft games in the areas they excel at, Wukong is at least “good” in every aspect. The game truly shines in its boss fights, the overall challenge, and the rewards for exploration. I’d compare it to the new era of God of War: while other games might do individual elements better, Wukong offers a well-rounded, complete package.Would I recommend this game to others? 100%Is the game worth getting at full price? 100%",Recommended,675,81.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 10
15556,"Let me just say, wow, amazing first AAA title for a company.Overall rating: 9/10Amazing game, cinematically and visually perfect. Gameplay wise, there are many frustrating points that feel unpolished, and design choices that I simply don't agree with, but respect that they're CHOICES that the devs made for their own vision and stuck with it.Pros:- Story - JTTW story and well done- Visuals - For the most part, the game is visually amazing. That being said, some of the chapters start looking the same no matter where you are, particularly the desert. When you're not near buildings it's just sand and rock everywhere for a good portion of the chapter.- Progression - You definitely feel stronger as you play through the game, develop your strategies, upgrade gear and gourds.- Combat - Generally quite enjoyable* - Animations are all fluid, and bosses all have unique movesets and many of them look absolutely amazing, an absolute treat reallyNeutral (design choices that I don't necessarily like):- Attack animations for your character can be extremely long for a relatively fast paced ARPG, often locking you in, with damage and value coming in the later parts of the combo. It's over 4 seconds of animation from start to end. On one hand if you know the bosses and timings for their attacks you can time the animations between what they do. Some bosses are just in constant attack chains and getting hit will cancel yours.- Enrage phases - this seems something that gets ""worse"" as you go through the game. Bosses having enrage phases (sometimes fully immune to damage during the phase) that can get excessively long. I get the design choice of wanting you to deal with certain moves and such, but it's also boring as hell just dodging for several minutes at a time waiting for the boss to tire itself out. Then one mistake later and bam, right back to the beginning and you have to go through this process all over again.- Respecs - I appreciate free respecs, however, the game uses this as a tool to force the player to take on different playstyles. The unfortunate part in all this is that armor also plays a role in your build, and is not free to craft (takes limited resources). So you might get to boss X while playing a spirit skill build (and invested all your resources crafting the armor) and the boss just punishes you 90% of the time you press spirit skill. This is neutral point to me because it breaks the flow of the game to go back and respec, learn a new playstyle, to deal with a boss. I'm sure for others this will be a pro.- Aerial bosses - enemies that spend most of their time in the air. Generally this isn't a common problem, but man, when it happens and you just can't reach the enemy, it feels really annoying.Cons (note that most of these are very nitpick or not common throughout the game, just in specific sections):- Hitboxes - enemies have massive area of damage and generally are far larger than their actual model / animation would suggest. Sometimes you'll do a jumping attack, be 1-2 meters over the enemy's attack, and still get hit and cancelled. Meanwhile the player's attacks are strictly to their model. So it happened a lot throughout the game where my attacks would miss by a pixel, dealing no damage, while getting hit by attacks far outside of their visual range.- Lock-on and camera - partially a continuation of the above, generally every enemy has a single lock-on point. For some bosses they'll change where the lock on point is, or position it in a not so useful place. For example, if you're trying to kill a giant and the lock-on is forced on the torso, your character will sit between the legs attacking the air under the torso. Camera panning is very slow and sometimes the angles are terrible. This is not exactly surprising as this is a common issue with a lot of souls like games, including fromsoft games in general. I wouldn't say it was any worse in this game, but still a source of frustration. Even locked-on, some bosses move around / into the air while your camera just doesn't pan enough to see them. The beautiful scenery (especially foliage) in boss arenas can really start to cover up the player camera.- Paths - oh man, walls, walls everywhere. This is a common problem throughout the entire game. There are invisible walls everywhere and it can feel very janky. Sometimes you can even see a path with enemies on it, but you're unable to get to it because of invisible walls between your current path and that path.- Platforms - generally the game doesn't let you fall off the map, except in a few parts of the game where you have to walk a tiny bridge with enemies attacking you from the sides. When you get too close to the edges, monke will just yeet himself off. So say you roll through an arrow, but your direction was 2 degrees off. Welp, off the map you go. The staff spin walk doesn't let you change direction so again, if your angle is slightly off you'll just walk towards the edge and monke will yeet himself off. These bridges don't appear too often but they do appear a few times and every time it's just a major wtf.- Mobility - moving through the map in general doesn't feel very fluid with all the invisible walls. Considering you're a monkey, you can't jump (high) can't climb can't crawl. You just end up running everywhere.- Rock Solid - This is the biggest con in the game for me. It's one thing for bosses to counter specific movesets / strategies, but man, rock solid is supposed to be the extremely tight timing, skill based parry, and later in the game every boss just ignores it. This is opposed to cloud step which is for the most part a very easy, lenient skill that doesn't seem to ever be countered and gives a free heavy attack. They both take the same slot. The choice of denying rock solid makes no sense to me.",Recommended,4774,35.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

COFF.. Concord, Outlaws, From Software COFF.. COFF..) Graphics are a chapter a part, we can stay here for days talking about how good the graphics are, I wish Capcom and From Software learn something here. The story telling of the game is amazing, each end of each chapter I become more amazed, I'm at the start of chapter 5 so far, and I loved every end of chapter so far, it's beautiful, it's emotional, it is twisted, how all stories should be. Yes the game should have a Map, a simple map it would make the game much more enjoyable, specially for me who have ADHD (More to come)60+ hours - Game Finished - One of the greatest story telling games I ever played, GOTY 2024 for sure. The secret last boss has one of the most epic fights of all time.

15595,"Black Myth Wukong is one of the games that delivers and lived up to the hype, from the compelling story of the events taking place after the famous Journey to the West, with its outrageous and unique enemy variety and design and amazing boss fights, I definitely had a freaking blast playing through this gem of a game and achieved 100% completion for the game. I really love the skill trees and the amount of skills you have in the game, with a bonus point of being able to re-spec to different playstyles and combining with different staff stances. Another thing I want to highlight is that the game isn't difficult at all, for me I found it pretty easy until towards the final bosses for the last 2 chapters which was a more challenging experience (also the fact that I have played many souls-like games), but BMW is an action rpg, not a soulslike.For someone who doesn't know about Journey to the West, I am now invested in this story after playing through this game. The developers have done an excellent job telling the story and my only feedback is that they should focus more on deciding where to put their invisible walls so it doesnt trick the players that we can explore more what we can see but it turns out its been blocked. Their level design also needs some improvement which I feel they can take some inspiration from FROMSOFTWARE games or Cyberpunk 2077 if they want to achieve verticality in their designs.Visually, Unreal Engine 5 is gorgeous and paired with the fantastic combat system, I didn't encounter any crashes, only some frame drops despite playing on ultra settings with raytracing, dlss and frame generation turned on. I'm eagerly waiting for the DLC which they can take the time to improve on their level design. Overall, 9/10 for me.",Recommended,1454,71.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

15615,"As a Taoist/Buddhist Chinese, Journey to the West (2011) was my jam when I was a kid. I remember that there was one channel airing this show, and every time I tuned in to watch it, I was amazed by all the cool stuff in the show. The choreography of Sun Wukong fighting yaoguais and gods in aerial combat, the crazy CGI effects, the world-building and beautiful scenery, the soothing opening of the Heart Sutra, and the legendary ending song, ""Where is the Road?"" All of these wowed me as a kid, and then this game decided to bring that same experience to the rest of the world.Game Science went all out with the trailers for this game. Every time they showed the game, whether it was gameplay videos or story trailers, they just kept getting better. They've shown so much, yet so little. This inflated the game's original scope to gargantuan proportions, along with the expectations. Even now, I still get chills every time I watch these trailers, and I've watched them a lot before the game's release. I was initially afraid that the game would be overpromising, mainly because it looked too good, almost unreal. And spoiler alert: this game did not disappoint and even exceeded my expectations. I completed the game in 60+ hours, which is pretty short, but it didn't feel short at all. It felt like a fulfilling journey from start to finish.First off, this is visually the best-looking game I've ever played. The lighting, the shaders, the atmosphere, the environment, the world-building, the unnecessarily detailed sculptures and elements of both Taoism and Buddhism, the snow, the sand, and the clouds are all as realistic and cinematic as you can get. The levels in the game are actually much bigger than you'd expect, given its linear nature. The game has a lot of very missable secrets too. Some of these secrets include hidden bosses, hidden dialogues and encounters, and even whole new areas. Without Googling them, I am sure that I would've missed a large chunk of what the game has to offer. There are many branching paths, and the game feels deceptively open. Because of this, you will inevitably encounter the dreaded invisible walls, which can break immersion.The combat is rather simple but has some depth. You have three stances to choose from on the fly, with spells that can paralyze enemies, buff yourself, turn rock solid to parry incoming attacks, or dash away and become invisible to get out of harm's way. You can also transform into the enemies you've slain for an immediate attack, and the transformation lasts for a short while. These transformation spells even have their own unique movesets. However, the core combat loop feels mostly the same throughout the game. You use light attacks to fill up your focus and unleash heavy attacks based on how many focus points you want to use. Which brings me to the next point, and why the combat, despite being simple and a bit repetitive, wasn't an issue for me.The biggest highlight of this game is the variety of bosses you will encounter. This game has so much enemy and boss variety, it's actually mind-boggling. There are literally more than 100 bosses, which is insane considering how they managed to pull it off. And these bosses are all unique, with very minimal reskins or copy-pasted enemies. Even when some bosses are reskins, they have very unique and different movesets, which makes fighting a familiar-looking foe feel like a fresh new experience. Because of this staggering amount of unique bosses, I never got tired of the combat, as every boss has different threats and attack patterns, with different openings and weaknesses to exploit.I enjoyed the game's story. I can see why people say the story is pretty confusing and so on. However, if you have a modicum of knowledge of Journey to the West (JTTW), you will be fine with the story. The game's story and characters are strongly related to the original telling of JTTW. Those very familiar with JTTW will find the story meaningful and can even point out small secrets in the cutscenes. Every time you finish a chapter, a beautifully animated musical video will play. It felt so rewarding to watch these musical videos after finishing the chapter. They're all really good and are absolute cinema. The developers didn't have to go this hard. The music is fantastic, from banger mantras to atmospheric music, boss themes, cutscene soundtracks, and the legendary leitmotifs of ""Where is the Road?"" are all top-tier.All this praise aside, there are a few cons I have to point out. The biggest issue is the performance. During the first week of the game's release, I spent 30% of my playtime adjusting the settings. This is more of Unreal Engine 5's fault. Every time a new asset appears on the screen, you will notice frame drops and microstutters. This is inherently Unreal Engine 5's flaw, and it will eventually get better. Because of these inconsistent frames and stuttering early on, it led to unfair deaths against some bosses. But after the patch, and with some registry editing mods from Nexus, I was able to get 60 FPS consistently on very high with hacked DLSS support on my RTX 2060.I also noticed that the later chapters of the game, Chapters 5 and 6, felt short and rushed. In Chapter 5, the frequency of boss fights felt too high. In Chapter 6, you're thrown into a massive open yet empty area. The first four chapters are much more fleshed out and don't have this issue.This game is special. It gave me the same sense of awe I felt as a kid watching Journey to the West on TV, and it surprised me countless times as I played. Not a lot of games have done that for me. This game also sparked a newfound appreciation for my culture. Seeing gods and deities I've actually seen and prayed to in temples come to life in the story, and even fighting them, feels so cool. Recently, I've been reading and researching stories of the gods and deities that I pray to, which also appeared in the game, as well as the lore of Journey to the West. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this game made me feel proud as a Taoist/Buddhist. This is my personal Game of the Year, 10/10.",Recommended,5050,61.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

15663,"I was skeptical about this game from its very first announcement (mostly because I thought it would never be released), but after seeing numerous positive reviews and hearing good feedback from my co-workers, I decided to give it a try.I’ve heard people comparing this game to GoW (by the way, have you played GoW?). Sure, there are some ""epic"" scenes, but I wouldn’t say the storytelling is particularly strong. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any consistent narrative flow - just disjointed parts here and there. This could be because I’m not familiar with Chinese culture, but it’s worth mentioning that I never expected strong storytelling. I’ve always viewed this as a typical Souls-like game, where you're left to investigate and piece things together on your own.Personally, I didn’t enjoy the sheer number of boss fights. I get that some players will appreciate the challenge, but for me, the amount was excessive. Almost every Souls-like game follows a similar formula: 20-30 minutes of exploring a location, fighting NPCs, collecting resources, and then a boss fight. However, in this game, the NPCs are extremely weak, and you’re constantly thrown into boss battles, one after another. (The biggest streak for me - 4 bosses in a row, but I think it will be more in a late game?)For those who really enjoy a tough challenge and love Souls-like games, this one will be right up their alley. But for me, it doesn’t even come close to GoW. I don’t understand why people are comparing these two completely different games. God of War had impeccable balance, a variety of gameplay mechanics, and flawless storytelling. It was engaging to explore the world, while this game just didn’t do it for me.In summary: from a gameplay perspective, no doubts, it is a really good try, but I found this game boring for me personally. If you’re not willing to spend 30-40 hours learning boss patterns, this game isn’t for you. There’s no good balance between relaxing and intense moments during the fights—you’re under pressure the entire time (except maybe in the early stages). I don’t want to invest my time in that.UPD: Although my overall experience was mostly negative, I want to pay respect when it's due, like certain boss interactions — grabbing you when you're on top of your staff or stealing your healing potion — those moments were really dope.",Not Recommended,1955,17.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

15679,i can say the graphics are great and the concept of the game is cool but if i could get a refund on this game after having to fight bosses 15 times in a row just to get somewhere in this game i totally would. i have been stuck on a boss for 4 going on 5 hours and im not bad at video games by no means but it just gets boring/frustrating when you have to sit there and fight someone so many times to win and cant. Some things these bosses can do are just to much when all you get s a staff and a couple power ups so saying all this i only recommend this game to someone who wants to deal with that. good luck.,Recommended,480,97.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

15697,"An absolute masterclass of an ARPG. Everything was painstakingly crafted from rich background material and moulded into something new and darker. The story of Journey to the West is known to most but this is a sequel. Animations, cutscenes, combat, visuals, story and character development... This game has it all. If you love a big, meaty action RPGs with rich lore and a great story then this game is for you, 100%.Small cons:1. Exploration is not exactly there because there are a lot of invisible walls in this game - far from open world. Still, it does not need to be open world if the world is that gorgeous.2. Some items are RNG based drops from enemies and harvesting plants. In a diablo style loot-driven ARPG this can work but not in a Soulslike or third person ARPG and might rub achievement hunters the wrong way.Overall a beautiful experience. 10/10 would recommend.",Recommended,728,88.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 10
