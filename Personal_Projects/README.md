### [Project 1: Retention & Churn Analysis for Bank Customers: Product Insights & Cohort Analytics](Retention-Churn-Analysis_Bank-Customers)
  > We aim to analyze user retention, churn drivers, and product adoption patterns for bank customers. The goal is to identify high-risk segments, understand product/behaviour patterns, and provide actionable insights for product and engagement strategies.

The original data we will be using is the **Bank Customer Churn Dataset** by *GauravTopre* on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset).
