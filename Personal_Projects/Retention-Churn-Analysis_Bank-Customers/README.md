# Retention & Churn Analysis for Bank Customers: Product Insights & Cohort Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes **user retention, churn drivers, and product adoption patterns** for bank customers using the **Bank Customer Churn Dataset** by GauravTopre (Kaggle).  

The goal is to identify high-risk segments, understand product/behavior patterns, and provide actionable **insights for product and engagement strategies**, simulating work done by Product Analysts and User Growth Analysts at fintech and tech companies (e.g., Stripe, Revolut, Grab, PayPal, Google).

## Objectives
- Measure overall retention and churn rates  
- Segment customers by product usage, activity, demographics, and geography  
- Conduct tenure-based cohort analysis  
- Build predictive churn model and interpret feature importance  
- Provide actionable product and engagement recommendations
