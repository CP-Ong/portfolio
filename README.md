# Data Analyst/Data Science Portfolio by Chen Ping Ong
This portfolio serves as a collection of projects and accomplishments to track my progress as an aspiring data analyst/data scientist. It showcases my skills and expertise in data analysis, data science, machine learning, and related fields. I am currently seeking a data analyst/data science role where I can apply my knowledge and grow further in the field.

## Background
- **Master of Mathematics**  
  - University: University of Warwick, United Kingdom  
  - Duration: September 2020 - July 2024

## Personal Data Science Projects
This section includes my personal projects.

### [Project 1: Predicting Stroke Using Machine Learning (Classification)](Data_Science/Classification_Stroke)
  > We aim to visualize the relationships between various habits/factors and strokes & predict stroke events with the best model and hyper-tuned parameters.

The original data came from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).

## Guided Projects
This section includes guided/beginner projects. The details on my guided data science projects can be found on [Beginner Data Science Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science), and the details on my guided Python projects can be found on [Beginner Python Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python).

### <ins>Data Science Projects (Machine Learning/Deep Learning)</ins>
### [Project 1: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning (Classification)](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Classification_Heart-Disease)
  > Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

The original data came from the Cleveland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
A version of it is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).

### [Project 2: Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers Using Machine Learning (Regression_Time-Series-Data)](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Regression_Bulldozer-Price)
  > How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

The original data came from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

### [Project 3: Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification (Image_Classification)](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Image-Classification_Dog-Vision)
  > Given an image of a dog, can we identify the breed of the dog?

The original data came from the [Kaggle's dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

### <ins>Python Projects</ins>
### [Project 1: Blackjack Card Game](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project1_Blackjack-Game)
  > Created a game of Blackjack.
### [Project 2: Turtle Crossing Game](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project2_Turtle-Crossing-Game)
  > Created a turtle crossing game using OOP.
### [Project 3: Flash Card App](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project3_Flash-Card-App)
  > Created a simple flashcard app using Tkinter and Pandas.

### <ins>SQL Project(s)</ins>
### [Project 1: Data Cleaning & EDA on the Layoffs Dataset](SQL/Layoffs-Dataset)
  > Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas hint towards a possible recession
  > and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has caused Meta to fire 13% of its workforce, which is more than 11,000 employees.
  > This dataset was made with the hope of enabling the Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights. (FROM KAGGLE)

In conclusion, I found companies with the most total layoffs per year (showing the top 5 each year).
The original data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).

### <ins>Microsoft Excel Project(s)</ins>
### [Project 1: Data Cleaning & Dashboard Creation on Bike Sales Dataset](Excel/Bike-Sales-Dataset)
  > This dataset contains data about bike sales depending on different variables such as marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home owner, cars, commute distance, region, and age.
  > Data cleaning is required before creating a useful interactive dashboard.

In conclusion, I cleaned the data and created an interactive dashboard.
The original data came from [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).
