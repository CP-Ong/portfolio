# Portfolio by Chen Ping Ong
This portfolio highlights my projects and accomplishments as an aspiring data scientist and machine learning researcher. It showcases my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and related fields. I am actively seeking opportunities in data analytics, data science, and machine learning research roles to apply my skills and grow further.

## Background
- **Master of Mathematics**  
  - University: University of Warwick, United Kingdom  
  - Duration: September 2020 - July 2024

## Personal Data Science Projects
This section includes my personal projects in data science.

### Project 1: Predicting Stroke Using Machine Learning (Classification) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](Data_Science/Classification_Stroke)
  > We aim to visualize the relationships between various habits/factors and strokes & predict stroke events with the best model and hyper-tuned parameters.

The original data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis Of Steam Game Reviews (Black Myth: Wukong) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](Data_Science/Sentiment-Analysis_Game-Reviews)
  > We aim to develop a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Steam reviews for Black Myth: Wukong. This model will identify key drivers of positive and negative user sentiment, providing actionable insights to help game developers address weaknesses and implement data-driven improvements that enhance player satisfaction.

The data was scraped from the [Steam Review Page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2358720/reviews/) for the game from *10 September 2024* to *14 November 2024* (around 2 months).

### Project 3: Sales & Customers Insights (Tableau) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](Data_Science/Tableau_Sales-Customers-Insights)
  > This project involves creating two interactive dashboards using Tableau to provide stakeholders, including sales managers and executives, with actionable insights into sales performance and customer behaviour. The dashboards are designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making by presenting key metrics, trends, and comparisons.

The dataset for this project was sourced from [DATA with BARAA](https://www.datawithbaraa.com/tableau/tableau-sales-project-thank-you/#google_vignette).

## Guided Data Science Projects
This section includes guided/beginner projects in data science. The details on these projects can be found on [Beginner Data Science Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science).

### Project 1: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning (Classification) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Classification_Heart-Disease)
  > Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

The original data came from the Cleveland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
A version of it is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).

### Project 2: Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers Using Machine Learning (Regression) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Regression_Bulldozer-Price)
  > How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

The original data came from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

### Project 3: Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification (Image_Classification) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science/tree/f05cfb090dfeb2adfc6d1d2ae54873b495255ab9/Image-Classification_Dog-Vision)
  > Given an image of a dog, can we identify the breed of the dog?

The original data came from the [Kaggle's dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

## Guided Python Projects
This section includes guided/beginner projects in Python. The details on these projects can be found on [Beginner Python Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python).

### Project 1: Blackjack Card Game &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project1_Blackjack-Game)
  > Created a game of Blackjack.
### Project 2: Turtle Crossing Game &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project2_Turtle-Crossing-Game)
  > Created a turtle crossing game using OOP.
### Project 3: Flash Card App &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python/tree/3050f4be5759b283307d1de0580f85ab9f730d1f/Project3_Flash-Card-App)
  > Created a simple flashcard app using Tkinter and Pandas.

## Guided SQL & Microsoft Excel Projects
This section includes guided/beginner projects in SQL and Excel.

### Project 1: Data Cleaning & EDA on the Layoffs Dataset (SQL) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](SQL/Layoffs-Dataset)
  > Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas hint towards a possible recession
  > and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has caused Meta to fire 13% of its workforce, which is more than 11,000 employees.
  > This dataset was made with the hope of enabling the Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights. (FROM KAGGLE)

In conclusion, I found companies with the most total layoffs per year (showing the top 5 each year).
The original data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).

### Project 2: Data Cleaning & Dashboard Creation on Bike Sales Dataset (Excel) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](Excel/Bike-Sales-Dataset)
  > This dataset contains data about bike sales depending on different variables such as marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home owner, cars, commute distance, region, and age.
  > Data cleaning is required before creating a useful interactive dashboard.

In conclusion, I cleaned the data and created an interactive dashboard.
The original data came from [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).
