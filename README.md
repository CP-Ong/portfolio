# Data Analyst/Data Science Portfolio by Chen Ping Ong
This portfolio serves as a collection of projects and accomplishments to track my progress as an aspiring data analyst/data scientist. It showcases my skills and expertise in data analysis, data science, machine learning, and related fields. I am currently seeking a data analyst/data science role where I can apply my knowledge and grow further in the field.

## Background
- **Master of Mathematics**  
  - University: University of Warwick, United Kingdom  
  - Duration: September 2020 - July 2024

## Projects
This section includes my personal SQL, Microsoft Excel, Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning projects. Furthermore, some beginner and guided projects I have done can be found on [Beginner Data Science Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-data-science) and [Beginner Python Projects](https://github.com/CP-Ong/beginner-projects-python).

## SQL Project(s)
### [Project 1: Data Cleaning & EDA on the Layoffs Dataset](SQL/Layoffs-Dataset)
  > Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards possible recession
  > and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.
  > This dataset was made with the hope to enable Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights. (FROM KAGGLE)

In conclusion, I found companies with the most total layoffs per year (showing the top 5 each year).
The original data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).

## Microsoft Excel Project(s)
### [Project 1: Data Cleaning & Dashboard Creation on Bike Sales Dataset](Excel/Bike-Sales-Dataset)
  > This dataset contains data about bike sales depending on different variables such as marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home owner, cars, commute distance, region, and age.
  > Data cleaning is required before creating a useful interactive dashboard.

In conclusion, I cleaned the data and created an interactive dashboard.
The original data came from [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).
